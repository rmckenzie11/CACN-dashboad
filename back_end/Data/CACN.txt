I'll take this opportunity to say how much I look forward to working with colleagues across the way and certainly on this side of the table.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I understand, Mr. Chair, that there's been discussion among the parties to introduce routine motions.

Indeed, we have a full gaggle of media outside the doors. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I move that for the rest of this meeting, prior to the routine motions, we invite our friends in from the media and televise the rest of this meeting. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Ms. Alleslev', " \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I would like to move a motion as well, but I'm not clear. Do you want me to move that motion now?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We have a motion before the committee. We don't debate the question of whether to televise or not. We simply vote on that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Then we'll go on from there. I did recognize Mr. Fragiskatos first. , \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Can I ask a question of the chair with respect to this?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My understanding was that there had been discussion among the whips of the parties and there was agreement just in the last hour or so that the meeting would be televised, that we would have the House of Commons television cameras. If the crew is available to do that camera work, that is usually the preference. I understand that if the House of Commons facilities for television are available, that is what is then allowed, and that is the standard procedure of committees. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I might want the chair to check that with the clerk, because I don't think it is in order to have a motion with respect to bringing in outside cameras when House of Commons cameras are available. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm advised, as previously noted, that there is interest from a network to carry this. The House is ready to televise the committee in the usual way if there is agreement to do that, but Mr. Doherty's motion is properly before the committee. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As there was no chair, the clerk made arrangements to have that ready if that was the will of the committee.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mr. Doherty, is that acceptable to you in relation to what you are seeking here today?, \n\xa0\nMr. Todd Doherty: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, Mr. Chair. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is it agreed?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Some hon. members: Agreed.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Chair: We'll have to pause for a few seconds as preparations to televise are made. \xa0\xa0(1310)\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\xa0(1310)\xa0\xa0\n\n, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We're back in session.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We now need to deal with routine motions.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Fragiskatos, you have some that have been distributed, as I understand it. , \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's correct, Mr. Chair. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'll just go through them one by one, if I may.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The first of these routine motions is as follows. It pertains to analysts:\n\n\n\nThat the Committee retain, as needed and at the discretion of the Chair, the services of one or more analysts from the Library of Parliament to assist it in its work. \n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0(Motion agreed to), \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The next motion relates to the subcommittee on agenda and procedure: \n\n\n\nThat the Subcommittee on Agenda and Procedure be established and be composed of six (6) members: the Chair, three Vice-Chairs, the Parliamentary Secretary; and one other Member from the Government.\n\n\n, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mr. Albas", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas (Central Okanagan?Similkameen?Nicola, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thanks, Mr. Chair. Congratulations on your election. It's a pleasure to serve with everyone here. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I certainly believe that we need to have routine motions, but I would like to propose a small change. I propose the following amendment that, after the word ?vice-chairs?, the comma, the words ?parliamentary secretary? and the semicolon be removed completely. If you find the motion in order, I would be happy to give a rationale for it. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I've also been told that one would have to change the number of committee members on the subcommittee, so it would change from ?six? to ?five?", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The motion to amend the motion is in order.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is there debate on the motion to amend?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes. I think that for the government, having both the chair and a member from the government side?they could choose a parliamentary secretary if they liked?would probably be suion, as indicated by the House of Commons. We think it affords an opportunity for the smaller parties to be fairly represented on the subcommittee. , \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I appreciate the member's remarks, but I want to say two things. First, let's put in perspective that the subcommittee really is there for scheduling, and any kind of decision from that body would have to be ratified by ours. At the end of the day, the committee members on this full committee are always going to get our way.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0However, I would also point out, from speaking to people who have served in previous minority parliaments, that the practice for a subcommittee is to have five members, not six. We don't need to reinvent the wheel. We are going to be productive on this committee. We just don't believe that a parliamentary secretary needs to be named specifically to it. A parliamentary secretary can be named as a member of the government or someone else can be. It's the pleasure of the government to decide who will serve on that subcommittee.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would just ask all members who believe that it should be five to vote in favour of that resolution and we can get on to the rest of the work of the committee. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Seeing no one else wishing to speak, I'll call on Mr. Oliphant", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I think a very important question is whether the official opposition will make a clear declaration that their intention is to work by consensus in this subcommittee as opposed to by voting. If we had an understanding that the opposition was in favour of all work at the subcommittee being done by consensus and reports made to the full committee being done by a consensus decision, then we would have no difficulty whatsoever with having five.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have not heard from the opposition that they are actually willing to work it by consensus. If I could get a statement clearly recorded that this would be our working mandate for the subcommittee, then we would not have a problem with that', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Albas', " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I don't mean to belabour this to committee, but, again, whatever the subcommittee decides must be ratified by this body. Whether there is consensus or not, if there's not a consensus at this committee, the full committee, it will not proceed.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I also would remind the member that if consensus could be had with two Liberals in addition to the chair, then you could get consensus with one. Just make sure that person is eloquent and reasonable", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Oliphant', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What I have asked for is a clear statement from the official opposition that they are prepared to work in consensus at the subcommittee. If I have a clear statement on the record that they are prepared to work in consensus, we will support the amendment', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Albas', " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0All I can say, without knowing the members, is that I'm not going to tie members' hands, whether they be official opposition members, other opposition members or government members. Democracy is how we get things done when people don't agree. I would just leave it to those members. I have faith that they'll be able to do it, especially if there are five", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We will hear from Mr.\xa0Bergeron, then Mr.\xa0Oliphant', " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron (Montarville, BQ): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Chair, in response to our colleague Mr.\xa0Oliphant's request, I would say that each and every member of the committee can rest assured that, for our part, we will work in full cooperation with all political parties.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I do not believe, and I stress, I do not believe this committee is the appropriate place for partisan wrangling. I think the purpose of this committee is to explore avenues for improved relations between China and Canada. I think it's imperative that we work in the spirit of collaboration.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If that is what our colleague is asking, I assure him of my full cooperation", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Oliphant', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We feel exactly the same way. We want a spirit of cooperation in all our business here. I feel we need to have something that is appropriate for all parties, in committee and at the subcommittee as well. I think cooperation is important, but I also think all parties need to have the opportunity to demonstrate the same commitment of which you spoke', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Seeing no other speakers, we have before us the motion to amend.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think the members are familiar with what the motion to amend says, so I will call for the vote.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Those in favour of the motion to amend, please raise your hands.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Those who are opposed to the motion, please raise your hands.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I didn't see the hand of Mr. Bergeron", ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think I was talking when you called the vote. I would point out that, in the spirit of what Mr.\xa0Oliphant was explaining, I personally could live with either one or the other, as long as things are done in the spirit of collaboration. However, I see that I have the deciding vote. I will be siding with my colleagues in the opposition', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The motion to amend is carried, so the motion is now amended.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0(Amendment agreed to)\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Chair: Now we're back to the main motion as amended. Is there any further discussion on the motion as amended?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mr. Oliphant", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would like to further amend the motion. I propose that the new period be changed to a comma, and it would say ?and that the subcommittee on agenda and procedure will work in a process of consensus decision-making.?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Madam Alleslev', ' \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Can you give us an idea of what you mean by consensus?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Oliphant', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Consensus means that we will work as a committee in the best interests of the tasks at hand, the five mandates that have been given to this committee; that we will work to present a unified voice to this body, which will then vote on and agree or not agree; and that we will strike very early in this process a collaborative spirit and work by consensus to attempt to find our meeting schedules, meeting times, witness lists, and whether we choose to have or not to have a report or interim report. If we can work that out by consensus in the subcommittee, I think for the work of this committee, even if it comes to a vote that is overturned in this committee, that will establish a routine way of working. If we can get those five people to agree on something, we will do better work and Canadians will be better served', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Alleslev', ' \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would like to add a further point to the concerns of our opposition colleague.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We always work in the spirit of collaboration to have a unanimous voice and be respectful of all our fellow members. However, it would be inappropriate to pass a procedural and routine motion amendment that would keep us from presenting both sides of the coin when we come back to committee. It would not serve us well and is not within the mandate of a subcommittee or a committee.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We will discuss and try to reach a consensus, but if we cannot, for example, if the issue is too important or the situation too critical, we would like the opportunity to restate our arguments and present both sides of the argument before the entire committee.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Therefore, I cannot support the amendment to write this down in black and white in our procedures. Nevertheless, we will aim for consensus', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Blaney', " \n\xa0\nMs. Rachel Blaney: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Chair. Congratulations on being appointed to this very important role on this very important committee.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I appreciate the discussion that's happening right now. I understand we're in a minority government. I've never done this before, so I have a lot to learn and I'm excited to do so. I believe that at the end of the day, Canadians are sending us to this place to work together collaboratively to get things done, and I have a great appreciation for that. What I'm curious about, though, is whether this is the usual practice. I have never seen this brought forward in routine proceedings before. This is only my second term. Is this something that's happened before? Is this something that is more reflective of a minority government? I need a little more information before I make my decision", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mr. Albas', " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I also agree that Canadians want parliamentarians to work together, particularly on a committee that's supposed to be rather germane in terms of scheduling. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I personally don't believe we need to have it. In fact, the one committee that does operate by consensus in this place is the Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations, which is for both the House of Commons and the Senate. Members work by consensus. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The problem is that if there is no consensus?and I've been in some of those meetings?you will go around for an hour on a simple ?Should it be a comma or should it be a semicolon?? if there cannot be a reasonable way to decide how to move forward, and that's by democratic vote.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I suggest that if the Liberals are truly concerned about consensus-building at the subcommittee, they send someone who is reasonable, and who not only has reasonable decorum but also brings forward proposals that people can get around. That's how you get people to agree, by listening and by doing that. You don't need to put that on a piece of paper; you just need to do it.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would suggest to this group that we carry on. Let's let the subcommittee form. Let's see how they do. If someone is not behaving, and not getting things done or being a block, you either have a vote or you come back to this committee and say, ?We're not working well. Send us some new members?, and we'll do that", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Fragiskatos.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Bergeron will then have the floor', " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To Ms. Blaney's point and to what Mr. Albas just said, there is a precedent for what Mr. Oliphant has put forward, which I think is very reasonable. It's not as if it's seeking to establish a precedent for how subcommittees work.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0A subcommittee of the foreign affairs committee is the international human rights committee, which has operated throughout its history by consensus, exactly along the lines Mr. Oliphant has described. I don't see why we can't take a path towards consensus in the way we've heard here. I think this is an opportunity to work collaboratively, in a way that Canadians would expect.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I go back and say that this exists. We have a subcommittee. I know Mr. Albas just talked about a committee of Parliament, but it's more apropos, to my mind, that we look at what precedent could exist on a subcommittee level in this Parliament, and that's the subcommittee on international human rights, which, as I say, has operated by consensus. I don't believe that principle has been broken for at least 10 years. My memory could be wrong on this, but it operates on consensus very well, and I think we could do the same here", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Bergeron, you have the floor', " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Chair, I would like to voice my concern.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This is the second routine motion and we are already struggling to agree. If we are serious about working collaboratively and in the spirit of consensus, we're going to have to make it easier to find ways to work together. Personally, I did not really have a problem with the word ?consensus? because consensus is not unanimity. For me, there is a very clear distinction between ?consensus? and ?unanimity?. When Mr.\xa0Oliphant said ?consensus?, I took it to mean ?in a spirit of collaboration?.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0But I feel like we're in a situation where we are going to have to throw the baby out with the bathwater. I don't like that at all. I don't know if, in a spirit of collaboration, Mr.\xa0Oliphant would be open to the idea of replacing the word ?consensus? with ?spirit of collaboration?, so as not to lose everything in the end", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We will now debate the subamendment Mr.\xa0Bergeron suggested.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Oliphant, you have the floor', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I agree.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I think it is absolutely fine to have that there.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It is clear to me that there\'s a difference between unanimity and consensus. Consensus generally means I may not agree with it but I can live with it. That is what has been my history. My history comes from the United Church of Canada. We work on a consensus model and we\'ve done that for the last 35 years. It means that we work towards something, we reach an opinion, we share an opinion and we hear each other. We may not agree with it but we can live with it, and we present it as such to the broader committee. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As to Ms. Blaney\'s comments, I worked on subcommittees for public safety, national security and citizenship and immigration. I was chair of those committees, and we did not take votes. We worked until we could reach an agreement, and I think that is something that is very good to do. However, I can also live with the sense of "in a spirit of collaboration?. That is also fine with me. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would be supporting Mr. Bergeron\'s subamendment to change that from ?consensus? to ?in a spirit of collaboration?', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is there further debate on this subamendment question?, \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I just want clarity on the wording.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is it ?in the spirit of collaboration??, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What Mr. Bergeron proposed was to remove the words ?consensus decision-making?. It would say, ?the subcommittee will work in a spirit of collaboration?.

Do we extend the meeting, given that we may have a number of witnesses per meeting and that may jam up the entire meeting?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Do we want to deal with the number of witnesses per meeting that we'll be calling?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 That's a question you're asking the whole committee and that could conceivably be a separate motion or matter for the subcommittee. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Albas", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, obviously it's a new Parliament, so we should start with this.

There could also be other situations. For example, when the Prime Minister appears, I would be very uncomfortable limiting his time to 10\xa0minutes if he wishes to take more.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0How are we going to handle this between us? We should discuss it now to avoid a deadlock in case the situation requires a change in this basic rule', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Oliphant', " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My understanding is that, generally, on parliamentary committees if there is unanimous consent to move away from routine proceedings, it is done on a meeting-by-meeting, case-by-case situation. The chair would test whether or not the committee.... If there are two panels in the same meeting, instead of two 10-minute periods, the chair and the clerk may offer advice to the committee that they take seven minutes or seven and a half minutes. If there is only one person that the committee wants to hear from, they may suggest to the committee that they want 15 minutes. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have never experienced that as a problem in committees. Generally it's at the discretion of the chair and the clerk and generally there is just nodding, or nodding off, of the committee members as they make that decision. I have never seen that as difficult. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the routine motions, we set the rounds. We're attempting in this motion to say that the government party takes 33% of the time. The Conservative Party, the official opposition, gets 33% of the time, and the NDP and the Bloc each get 17% of the time. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The government is showing generosity in allowing more time for the opposition than for the government side and that is the routine proceeding. When we get into meeting by meeting, case by case, then we trust the chair and the clerk to advise our committee and we will agree or not agree, but that is at the discretion of the chair", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Bergeron, you have the floor', ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I feel I must go back.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I understand completely what Mr.\xa0Oliphant is saying, but I also recall situations where government parties were less cooperative when it came time, say, to question the Prime Minister.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I am of the opinion that 10\xa0minutes for a Prime Minister might not be enough. I would suggest that, for the opposition parties, the time proposed here to question the Prime Minister may not be sufficient either. I would not want us to find ourselves in a situation where, having tabled a request to increase the speaking time, we would be denied by the government', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Fragiskatos', " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I hope we can get back to that word ?consensus? here on the issue, but I think that it would be wise perhaps to send this matter to the subcommittee to examine. When it comes to witness time and this sort of thing, that's not unimportant. It's very important, but it's a matter specifically for the subcommittee to work out. At least, that's been my experience.

Often, this won't even go to the subcommittee. The chair and the clerk will advise us and we'll make a very quick decision at the beginning of a meeting.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We're expecting to have a significant number of witnesses. We'll have other meetings with lengthy briefings. We're going to have lots of work to do, so I would like to take this as a start.

That Mr. Barton be given 20 minutes to update the committee on the state of relations between Canada and the People's Republic of China and that the remaining time be allotted for questions and comments from Members of the committee.\n\n\n, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm going to ask that, in the future, members make sure to submit any notices of motion to the clerk.

This will help us, even before we get to our subcommittee meeting, to determine what precisely we want to study, to understand the status, the lay of the land from Canada's man on the ground, as they say, so that we can identify not only what the situation is at the moment in an informed and timely way, but also the government's direction to the ambassador, in terms of how our country is approaching China. We're advocating for him to be the first witness so that this can inform everything that we do and ask afterward. Because it is such a time-sensitive thing, we would like it to be as soon as possible, i.e", ' when the House resumes next Monday.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We will hear from Mr.\xa0Oliphant and then Mr.\xa0Bergeron', " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you very much for this.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to state the position on this side of the table very clearly. We are absolutely in favour of calling Dominic Barton, the Ambassador of Canada to the People's Republic of China, as an early witness. We think it is critical to hear from Mr. Barton and think that his insights will be helpful and important to the committee to hear at a very early stage in this study.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0However, we also recognize that we do not all have the same level of experience or knowledge with respect to the issues we have been assigned to study by the House of Commons. We've been asked to look at, but not limit ourselves to, the consular, economic, legal, security and diplomatic relations we have with the People's Republic. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We think that to do that effectively and for us to ask the best questions?because asking good questions is part of our role as members of Parliament?it would be more helpful if, in the first one or two meetings, we had briefings from officials who could help lay the groundwork and bring everyone up to speed on the most recent issues we have been facing. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0They could be officials from Global Affairs Canada, which also includes international trade. They could be officials from Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. They could be anybody else we decide would help us understand these issues clearly and more effectively, so that we can ask ask better questions. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As the parliamentary secretary to the former minister and now to the current minister, I've had tremendous opportunities both to travel to China and to have briefings by our officials. I have found these briefings to be valuable and insightful. I won't say I have agreed with everything I ever heard in a briefing?that's my nature?but they have helped me to do my job better. I think we have one of the best public services in the world. Our public servants are effective and efficient, and I think this committee would be well served to have them for our first meetings, and then our first witness could be Mr. Barton. I am absolutely in agreement with the sentiment of the motion that he be the first witness we hear from. However, I think as Parliament resumes it is absolutely important for all of us to get on the same page, to have our various levels of knowledge equalized?and it's unfair that the government side could have more knowledge than the opposition side because we have access to briefings.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This would be the same as every parliamentary committee I have been engaged with that undertakes a study. When you undertake a study, you ask not only your Library of Parliament analyst to prepare briefing materials, but also officials to come to present the topic. I think every committee I've been on that has engaged in a significant study has done that kind of work. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Often then, the minister would come either at the beginning or end of the study. I think in this case it would be an excellent idea to have our ambassador come, but we would suggest that doing that on Monday, January 27 would be a week or two premature, being before we have had two or three meetings to do the kind of work I mentioned. Again, I think we should take this to the subcommittee on agenda and let it really wrestle with what kinds of briefings would be effective and important and helpful to the committee, and then go from there to bringing a recommendation on that to the committee at its next meeting and we would get going very quickly. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We recognize this is an important study. We also recognize that the motion, as presented by Mr. O'Toole, did not put an end date on when we're required to report. It was suggested by the NDP, by Mr. Harris, that we have an end date. Because we don't have an end date, I think we are not urgently rushed to get this work done in the first week. Let's take our time and do it well.\xa0\xa0(1355)\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I am also very aware of the comments in Mr. Bergeron's speech with respect to this motion, where he was in agreement with the whole motion but was concerned about paragraph (k) of the motion. To make sure that we don't go down the path of having a political theatre moment at that first meeting, it would be in the spirit of what Mr. Bergeron said that we would actually hear from our officials first.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would suggest to the subcommittee that we get an update on the general diplomatic relations so that we are all aware of what has transpired in recent months, what has transpired with respect to the consular cases, not only those of Mr. Spavor and Mr. Kovrig but also any other consular cases that might be of concern to the committee, to make sure that we do this carefully and are aware of the public security issues before we engage too much in our work. This is an extremely important national security matter, and the well-being of specific Canadians in detention in China needs to be considered alongside the well-being of Canadian businesses doing important agricultural and other business in China, and the people-to-people relationships that we enjoy between Canada and China. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We are in agreement with the motion. We think that the timeline of January 27 is not appropriate, and that we should have two or three briefings before we do that. All I'm suggesting is that we delay it a week or two to allow the committee to do its work well and carefully and for it to ask the best questions possible.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Bergeron, you have the floor', " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Chair , allow me to commend Mr.\xa0Oliphant for the excellent interpretation of my thoughts he offered a few moments ago.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Having said that, I find that this is indeed an extremely relevant resolution, but it may not be appropriate at this time.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I do not in any way dispute the appropriateness of calling Canada's ambassador to China before this committee to present his version, his analysis of the situation. However, the fact is that?and it must be acknowledged?regardless of the Canadian ambassador to China's intrinsic qualities, the post was vacant for eight months. For eight months, during this lengthy crisis, the ambassador's position was left vacant by the Liberal government. Before we summon the incumbent, perhaps we need to know why the position was left unfilled for eight months.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I agree with Mr.\xa0Oliphant's proposal that we hear from foreign affairs officials, that the Library of Parliament conduct an analysis and, above all, that we have the opportunity to meet in subcommittee. We have just set up the subcommittee to determine the agenda items.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This proposal, as relevant as it is, seems a little premature to me, in that we need to organize the work of this committee before embarking headlong into a poorly prepared meeting with the Canadian ambassador in Beijing. It is important to meet with the Canadian ambassador in Beijing, but it is especially important to be extremely well prepared for the meeting we will have with the ambassador. I don't think we are going to be able to do a constructive job with a week's notice for this meeting with the Canadian ambassador to China", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Alleslev', " \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First and foremost, I would like to say that we on the official opposition side are highly sensitive to the individuals who are wrongfully imprisoned in China and to not doing anything that would in any way put their release in peril. That is not the goal of our wanting to have the ambassador come. We understand the incredible work that's being done there. We don't want to do anything to jeopardize that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0However, we do want to hear from the ambassador. He is an official of the Government of Canada, he is the most senior official, and he is Canada's voice, although he isn't elected, obviously, and is not a minister. He should be able to speak on all things. Regardless of the information we have, he should be able to give us the information that he gives around the world, certainly in China and to other people.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We are asking for a briefing from him so that he can give us an overview of all the consular, diplomatic, trade and security aspects that apply to his position. We want to have that sooner rather than later so it can inform us when we dive deeply into the other things. It is our intention to have the opportunity to study all of those areas and that we will hear from officials who will give us more information in each one of those areas. Without a clear overview of the government's strategy towards the relationship with China, which would come from the ambassador, as well as a current update on the status of that relationship?it's the responsibility of the ambassador to advise us on it?we won't be able to know which officials to call and what information there is to do a deep dive on later.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0So yes, there is a sense of urgency. The relationship is deteriorating, and we as a committee would like to be able to do some homework and provide recommendations so that we can ensure the relationship doesn't deteriorate any more and we are able to protect national security interests, economic interests and diplomatic interests of Canada", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Blaney', " \n\xa0\nMs. Rachel Blaney: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for this very interesting conversation. I agree that it is incredibly important and very urgent. Having the point person here and talking to the committee is really key in moving forward.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm curious. With this sense of urgency, if there's a lot of briefing information that needs to be given, is there a reason why some of that work can't be done quickly, even this week, so that we can move forward? Again, urgency is key here. I don't think anybody would have said, when this motion came to the House, that this is something that we can take a lot of time learning about. We need to get on point. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm very supportive of this motion. I think we need the ambassador here as the point person to update us. A lot of us would appreciate the briefing material as soon as possible so we can get up to speed", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Fragiskatos', " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0No one around the table, certainly not on this side, is disagreeing with the need to bring in the ambassador so he can shed light on the situation and we can ask questions, but there is an obligation.... Granted, this point has been made, but I speak individually here as a member. I feel much more comfortable questioning the ambassador after a briefing so that the proper foundation can be established and we can then talk to our officials about what is going on and understand more about all of those issues.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To the point Ms. Blaney just raised, I think our officials also need time to adequately prepare as well. Yes, granted, they're working on the issue and have been for some time, but let's establish an order of operations here that makes sense. Immediately leading with the ambassador is just putting the cart before the horse, quite frankly", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Doherty', " \n\xa0\nMr. Todd Doherty: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to start off by saying that I really appreciate Mr. Oliphant's comments. Having spent over a decade working in China, I know the nuances and the sensitivities around certain issues. Any time we were going in-country to do work within China, we were briefed, as officials of Canada, by the most senior official on the ground.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think it would behoove this committee to start with the most senior official on the ground who is the most familiar with all the geopolitical sensitivities we have and who informs the other officials. As we move forward throughout this committee, it is going to be very important that we have this information in advance of our questioning of other officials, so that we understand the sensitivities and the security issues that may arise from our line of questioning. That can only come from the ambassador.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think it's very important that we start off this committee on the right foot, which would be to bring the most senior official here. It's no different from any other time we do business with China and are briefed by the most senior official on the ground so that we understand our work as we move forward.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To Mr. Bergeron's comments, this will then form our agenda as we move forward into a subcommittee. As was mentioned earlier, in the spirit of co-operation or consensus, we then can agree on the areas of concern and on those we want to bring before this committee", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mr. Barrett', " \n\xa0\nMr. Michael Barrett (Leeds?Grenville?Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thanks, Mr. Chair. I'm in violent agreement with my colleague, Mr. Doherty. However, I appreciate the comments of Mr. Oliphant, Mr. Bergeron and Ms. Blaney. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That being said, I do believe that Canadians expect to hear from that ambassador. That's why we've started laying the groundwork for televised meetings, the committee has been constituted and we're here before the House resumes after the Christmas break. I believe that we should hear from the ambassador next week.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To the points of my colleagues on having some briefings in advance, I think Ms. Blaney's point about having those briefings this week would satisfy all of the concerns that have been expressed, so that we act quickly and hear from our first witness, the ambassador, next week. In the meantime, by having the deputy minister of foreign affairs provide a briefing to the regular members of this committee this week and having the national security adviser provide a briefing to regular members of the committee this week, we would be well informed and would have the full suite of information that is available to those departments they represent.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The information they provide to the government would be available to the members of the committee. Then, when we hear from our top official on this file, our ambassador, we will have all of that information, and the concerns will have been satisfied. Members of Parliament are seized with this issue. They've been engaged. They have done work. I'm confident that, with the level of commitment colleagues here have given to this issue, they're prepared to do the work and to hear from those officials as soon as possible, so that we can get down to the work the House has instructed us to do. That's what Canadians expect.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I don't think it needs to be one or the other; I think we can do both. We can hear from those important officials?the deputy minister of foreign affairs and the national security adviser?this week provided they are in-country. I know that the ambassador has corresponded with Ms. Alleslev and has said that he is eager to appear, just as Canadians are eager to hear from him and just as the regular members of this committee would be eager to ask questions of him following his testimony", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mr. Albas', " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Barrett has struck a couple of different ideas with me.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First of all, I'd like to address Mr. Oliphant's key point, that some parliamentarians are disadvantaged because they don't have access to the government, such as government members or parliamentary secretaries. There is an imbalance. That being said, that's why parliamentary committees are separate from government. We have analysts, I'm sure, for members who miraculously cannot find the time after being named to this committee. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I've already taken out a few different books so that I can have an at least cursory understanding of all the different issues. I read many of the columns of the media who are here today that are informing of what the issues are. I think I can find enough questions. However, if members feel disadvantaged and don't feel that they'll have questions at the start of this committee's work, the Library of Parliament analysts will be able to supply them with good material that will help them to get a good sense of things. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Members opposite have not moved to amend. They agree that the ambassador is important and, from my understanding, the ambassador has actually shown interest in coming to the committee once it's ratified by members, but it's the dates that are in question. As well, there is this information power imbalance, that Mr. Oliphant mentioned, which seems to be the issue.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Perhaps what we can do is to have a three-hour meeting next Monday. We'll do an hour with, as you mentioned, the national security adviser, the acting one, as well as the deputy minister of foreign affairs and trade. We'll start from there for the first hour, and then we'll have the ambassador. We also have to bear in mind that the ambassador may have something come up that he needs to respond to. It seems that he indicated that in late January he would be willing to come forward.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Let's start working on this. I'm fine to manage my workload and to engage the Library of Parliament so that I can be informed and can ask good questions of Mr. Barton. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If you look at the original motions presented to the House, which it agreed with, from time to time we may call upon certain officials. That means that, perhaps at another juncture, we may have more questions because of what we've heard from various experts within Canada or outside. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This is not going to be a one-time process. It doesn't necessarily have to be. My friend from the Bloc mentioned earlier that the process now is that the subcommittee is supposed to handle the agenda. I totally understand what he means, but we're the client, right? We've hired the subcommittee, like a contractor, to handle certain things, but if we want a meeting to start with, just to open up the conversation and then let the members from that point start planning witnesses and the order of things, we can do that. I don't find a flaw with what he said; I'm just pointing out that you can also look at it from another perspective. I'm hopeful that members will be amenable to it, and that perhaps a motion can be added so that we also have the acting national security adviser and the deputy minister on the 27th. To me, that would be a good way for us to get started.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I trust that members will do their homework, and I will do mine", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Albas's comments remind me that before we finish today, we should try to deal with questions like the time of meetings, the usual meeting time and the frequency of meetings.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Oliphant", " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I just repeat that there is absolutely no disagreement on this side that the first external witness will be the ambassador of Canada to China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My experience may be different from others. I travelled to three countries in Africa last week and immediately upon arrival in each of those countries I had very good briefings by the heads of mission in those countries. Absolutely, we trust our heads of mission?ambassadors, high commissioners, charg?s d'affaires?to do the work of briefing us on the ground. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0However, before I left I had extensive briefings from departmental officials, those with desks in Global Affairs Canada, who brought up issues of consular affairs, international trade, investment, the issues I would be encountering so that I could have an effective trip on behalf of the people of Canada. I think that is the normal process that we engage in. We get written materials and have briefings from officials and then we have the heads of our missions do that work.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In a moment I am going to be presenting an amendment to the motion, but before I do that I want to take us back to the 40th Parliament. This is not the first time we have had a special committee established by the House on an international issue. The last time, in the 40th Parliament, an international committee was established to look at our mission in Afghanistan.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0With all due respect to Ms. Blaney, we don't have Jack Harris here. His experience on that special committee, which lasted almost three years and wrote a number of reports, would be invaluable to our agenda subcommittee. I think his experience on that committee?and I was serving with him on another committee at the same time?and his understanding of the briefings, the role of expert witnesses and the roles of others who have differing opinions would be very helpful for us to consider at the agenda subcommittee. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We've just established the agenda subcommittee. I think we should use it. It needs to make some recommendations with respect to the timing of our meetings and the number of meetings we have per week. Remember, this is not a standing committee that follows the normal slots of (a), (b), (c) and (d) committees. We have to request our officials to appear. We have an ambassador who is in China. We want him to be here as soon as possible and we want to make the most effective use of his time and our time. This is something that we need to settle in to. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Parliament is just resuming next week. Most of us have other committee responsibilities. We want to get all of that fed into the agenda subcommittee so that every member can find a way to be their most effective in this committee. A meeting time and our meeting frequency are practical ways of working that I think would be best dealt with at the subcommittee on agenda. I just think it is an easier place than doing it here in this room.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I am going to suggest an amendment to Ms. Alleslev's motion. The first two lines are the same. However, we we would strike the words ?on Monday, January 27, 2020?, and add this at the end so that the motion will be reading as such: ?That the committee invite the Ambassador of Canada to the People's Republic of China, Mr. Dominic Barton, to appear in person before the committee for a two-hour televised meeting; that Mr. Barton be given 20 minutes to update the committee on the state of relations between Canada and the People's Republic of China; and that the remaining time be allotted for questions and comments from members of the committee; and that this meeting happen as soon as possible after the subcommittee has met and the full committee has appropriately been briefed by officials as determined by the committee, and subject to the scheduling by the clerk of the committee.?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If I can just speak to my amendment, I think we are keeping the spirit of Ms. Alleslev's motion to make sure we have as immediate a meeting with Mr. Barton as possible, that we do it subject obviously to scheduling but also subject to the work of the subcommittee getting together, determining and recommending to the committee what briefings would be appropriate, and that we do that within the next couple of weeks. \xa0\xa0(1420)\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 That's all. We are talking about a couple of weeks to make sure that we are organized. That's what I have to say", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Oliphant.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We are now discussing the proposed amendment. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Zann', " \n\xa0\nMs. Lenore Zann: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here and to meet everybody. As a new member of Parliament, I want to say one reason I'm happy to be on this committee is that, first and foremost in my mind and in the minds of many of my constituents is the safety of the two Canadians who are detained in China. I think we need to not let go of the reason we're here and the reason we're talking about these very important issues.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to hear from the ambassador. I also want to hear from experts. I'm perfectly willing to read as much information as anybody wants to send us, but I also want to see them in person and be able to ask questions in person.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think that time is of the essence?I agree with everybody here on that?but over the last year or so having watched on television what can happen in these committees, I do not want to see this devolve into a partisan, empty-rhetoric fight among political parties over political points. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On that note, I would like to say that, yes, we need to see the ambassador. When that ambassador can come to see us is going to be up to all of us. It is a democracy, after all. However, I'm very concerned and I do not want to see this become a political free-for-all. I think that it's important that we keep the safety of those two Canadians first and foremost in our minds as we go about our deliberations. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Alleslev, and then Mr. Albas is after Mr. Doherty', " \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My fear is that this sounds like an opportunity to put it further into the future and to not, maybe, address the sense of urgency that we have been trying to achieve with the motion. I'm wondering how we might be able to ensure that there's a sense of urgency, rather than saying, ?As soon as possible when the subcommittee meets, and we've met with other people, and, and, and, and...?, which could sound like sometime in the next century.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Obviously we want this to happen sooner rather than later. Obviously, we have somewhat of a disagreement on who should give us an overview first before taking a deep dive into each of the officials' areas of expertise. We understand the amendment you're putting forward, and we do want, obviously, the subcommittee to be able to do its work. How can we bound this so that it happens, I would say, in no more than a month, to ensure that we keep the sense of urgency on it? Perhaps there's another way of arriving at a point where we could do it even more quickly than that", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Doherty', " \n\xa0\nMr. Todd Doherty: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair?, \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On a point of order, it seems to me there was a suggestion, but I didn't hear a subamendment. I'm just wondering whether there was a subamendment there or not. That may be a way for us to get out of this quickly. If there was a subamendment coming from the suggested date, I think that would be acceptable. I have said two weeks. You said up to a month. I just think we may be able to get out of this very quickly if there is a subamendment", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Doherty, do you mind if I go back to Ms. Alleslev?, \n\xa0\nMr. Todd Doherty: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I have some information that might be pertinent to the committee, and perhaps a subamendment might come out of that. It is being reported that Ambassador Barton is indeed in Winnipeg at the cabinet retreat currently, with your colleagues, so he is in Canada.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We are here to work.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To Lenore, to your comment, first and foremost we must always be moving forward with that. The lives of Mr. Spavor and Mr. Kovrig.... Time is of the essence, which is why we put forward the motion that we speak to the most senior official who is informing our government, and to the rest of the officials, on the sensitivities and the situation analysis on the ground. If he is indeed in Canada?, \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0He's not. He went back to China this morning", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Todd Doherty: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I think we should confirm that. We should move to try to get Ambassador Barton at the earliest convenience', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Can I allow Ms. Alleslev to respond to Mr. Oliphant?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Or is it Mr. Albas?, \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Albas can do two things at once here', " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, I think I understand where members are coming from.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Perhaps a subamendment would be helpful in this case, and I hope that it is: ?That the subcommittee meet no later than January 24 at the call of the chair.?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The committee can meet this week; we could probably just put that into it. I think you could just canvass the members. As long as the subcommittee happens this week then we can issue a report and then see that the business of the committee starts as soon as possible.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I will say, again, Mr. Chair, that people expect us to work together, but that also means productively, so let's not get tangled up in knots. Let's get the steering committee to meet this week and have the ambassador no later than February 7.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To me that is a good way to have things presented", " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, as a point or order, could I ask for a temporary suspension of the meeting so that we can discuss this subamendment to my amendment?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The meeting is suspended.\xa0\xa0(1430)\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\xa0(1445)\xa0\xa0\n\n, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Order.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Colleagues, I think the public often doesn't understand?perhaps when the cameras are not on or when we're not in session?how members do operate in a collaborative fashion and work things out. It can't always be done, but sometimes it can. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In that spirit, Ms. Alleslev, over to you. , \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much and thank you to all colleagues. Sometimes having a logistics background is probably the most difficult part of doing some of these things.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could I seek unanimous consent to withdraw the motion, the amendment to the motion and the subamendment to the motion so that I might present a new motion?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0(Motion withdrawn [See Minutes of Proceedings]), \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The new motion would read: ?That the subcommittee on agenda and procedure meet as soon as possible; and that the committee be briefed by officials prior to the appearance of the Ambassador of Canada to the People's Republic of China; and that the committee invite the Ambassador of Canada to the People's Republic of China, Mr. Dominic Barton, to appear in person before the committee for a two-hour televised meeting no later than February 7, 2020; and that Mr. Barton be given 20 minutes to update the committee on the state of relations between Canada and the People's Republic of China; and, that the remaining time be allotted for questions and comments from the members of the committee.?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0(Motion agreed to [See Minutes of Proceedings]), \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Albas", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, I think it's very important to note that today there are three members from British Columbia who made this possible.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Voices: Oh, oh!, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is that because there aren't 250 centimetres of snow in Vancouver or...?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's just how we do things", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We need to deal with the questions of the usual meeting time and the frequency of meetings.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 As for the time, I am advised that a special committee has priority on rooms and on being televised. We can meet any time we want to, but we only have priority on these times: from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Mondays, from 8:45 a.m. to 10:45 on Fridays, and from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m', ' Monday to Thursday.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What would committee members prefer?[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Fragiskatos', " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, I know this is important because we want to know when we'll be working, but two of our vice-chairs are not here. Mr. Harris and Mr. Warkentin are not here. With that in mind, I think this issue is probably best left to the subcommittee, especially since we don't know the vice-chairs' schedules", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Alleslev', " \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have two things. One, I think it's a good idea for the subcommittee to investigate this as well, but perhaps, just so we can all weigh in, because we do need all our committee members to weigh in on this.... On the official opposition side, we were thinking that maybe we would meet one day a week, but instead of for only two hours, perhaps we could consider three hours. Our thought was for Mondays from 10 a.m. until 1 p.m", " if that's a possibility. Then we would be able to still have a sense of urgency, get a fair amount of work done, and get together and make some progress. That's what we were thinking, but perhaps we would put it to the subcommittee to investigate further", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Perhaps we'll have Sunday brunches instead of Sunday suppers?at home, that is.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Blaney", " \n\xa0\nMs. Rachel Blaney: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I agree that this should go to the subcommittee. I recognize that there are two vice-chairs who are not here, and that's an important part.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think the only thing that would be helpful to add is that the three-hour meeting from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. would probably work for Mr. Harris, who will be representing the New Democrats. However, one of the questions I would have is around televised access for the three hours. I hope the subcommittee is given that important information", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Maybe I could answer the question about the television before we go on to the next speaker.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I indicated previously that we have priority over rooms and television from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Mondays. I presume that if the committee were to decide to make that 10 a.m. to 1 p.m', ' there are no other committees meeting then, so it would not be a problem. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Oliphant', " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I believe there's been some discussion among the whips about this. I think it should go to the subcommittee.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We'll just signal that we are in agreement with Mondays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. We think that's a good solution, but subject to the approval of the two vice-chairs. We're going to be meeting as soon as possible as a subcommittee anyway, so it will be good", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you. That's useful.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Barrett.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Bergeron will then have the floor", " \n\xa0\nMr. Michael Barrett: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, as we lay the markers down for when we're going to be having these meetings and the projected order of business for the committee, I think it's important to note that ?as soon as possible? means different things to different people. We've rightly identified that the work of this committee is urgent because we have Canadians who are illegally jailed in China. It's very important that we understand that today's meeting was the last day that this committee was allowed to have its first meeting, as directed by the House. We give ourselves a timeline, time goes by quickly and we find that we've used it all up, and ?as soon as possible? was actually the last possible allowable time to make it happen.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's also important to note that we have farmers across Canada who have lost over a billion dollars because of the trade actions China has taken, specifically dealing with canola. I think it's really important that we're cognizant of that and mindful of all of the different areas?and there are many more?that this relationship between Canada and China has affected, and of why it's so important that the important work of this committee be done expeditiously and that we give ourselves time-bound guidelines in directing our work.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It is vital to so many parts of our federation and its citizens that we act quickly, so I ask all members to be mindful of that. When we say things like ?as soon as possible?, the spirit or intent of that, I believe, is good, but I think it's important that we act on that and truly do it as soon as possible, because when we just do it at the last date that is allowable, we might not be fulfilling the spirit of the obligation that we have.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Oliphant.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm sorry, Mr.\xa0Bergeron, it is your turn to speak", " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Chair, I know that our colleague just went back to the motion we just passed, but I thought we were trying to determine the most appropriate times to meet.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would just like to ask a question. Our colleague, in presenting the Conservatives' proposal to meet Mondays from 10\xa0a.m. to 1\xa0p.m", ' told us that they felt it would be better to meet once than twice, and for three hours rather than two. It seems to me that twice for two hours is more than once for three hours. So I would like someone to explain to me why we prefer one three-hour meeting over two two-hour meetings.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My second question involves the expression ?as soon as possible?. Let me share with you a past experience I had with Chinese representatives a few years ago during a previous term in the House of Commons. We were in contact with, among others, people representing Taiwan. They told us they planned to open an office in Montreal soon. A country that is several thousand years old has a different definition of the word ?soon? than a country that is barely 400\xa0years old. To my knowledge, the office has yet to be opened in Montreal. So that is something to consider.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When we say ?as soon as possible?, it must be understood that there is a sense of urgency. Not only are the economic interests of Canada and Quebec at stake. The lives of at least two Canadian citizens are as well. We must therefore proceed with diligence. We have set a deadline for a meeting with the ambassador, which is February\xa07, and I believe the ambassador will arrive in North America on January\xa028. That means he could join us in the next few days, perhaps January\xa029 or January\xa030. Those dates do not, however, fall on a Monday between 10\xa0a.m. and 1\xa0p.m.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0So I ask you again: why should we meet once for three hours instead of twice for two hours? Honestly, I prefer two two-hour meetings. I believe we stand to get more work done in two two-hour meetings than one three-hour meeting', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I will now give the floor to Mr.\xa0Oliphant. If anyone wishes to answer Mr.\xa0Bergeron's questions, I will give you the opportunity to do so, but it is now Mr.\xa0Oliphant's turn", " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I think it would be very appropriate for us to take this discussion now to the subcommittee. Everybody will have the opportunity to talk about two twos, one three, three fives, two nines or I don't know what, but I think we can have that discussion there when people know their committee responsibilities and the other things that are on people's minds. I actually think it's not going to be productive for us to continue at this time.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We've signalled that we think it's a good option. I'm happy to listen to the other parties and, in the spirit of collaboration, to find times that work. I just think it would be most helpful if we now take that discussion into that venue to look at the calendar. The subcommittee should look at a working plan. Maybe we start with three-hour meetings and then move to five evenings in a row. I chaired the special committee on assisted dying. We had to meet every evening. We took every slot from 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. most days to get that work done. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think that will be something we need to discuss.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0With respect to ?bient?t?, or the way we're working, on behalf of our side I just want to thank the clerk for putting this meeting together. The parties got you the names at the last minute. One party was late. We were pretty good, but parties got the names to you late. You had logistics to deal with. Putting a special committee together is unusual and I want to thank you. I also know the analysts have already been anticipating our motion and getting work done. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I also want to say two things. I think we should acknowledge, in this room, the people of Newfoundland and Labrador, particularly in Newfoundland and in St. John's and other parts on the eastern side. Jack Harris is not with us today. That is a reality of life that we have to be sensitive to and he was very gracious. I talked to him about the possibility of our rescheduling and that it would take the House consent, but that is a reality.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The other extreme reality that many of us have faced in our own ridings is the death of 57 Canadians in Tehran. While this committee is important and our relationship with China is important, some of us have been very preoccupied with that. I have a high school mourning a death in my riding. I have families mourning in my riding. That has occupied many of us. We are working on this issue but we don't let the other issues go. Our world is complex, our world is difficult and people's lives are affected by these things. I think having this meeting is not late; it's timely. I think the House is managing us well and we'll do our part. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think every member of this committee will help the clerk and the analysts do their work so they can help us do our work. We're getting the date done, so thank you very much. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mr. Oliphant, in respect of your comments in relation to the clerk and the analysts, and in relation to your concern regarding the people who were the victims of flight 752 and their families, I am sure all members would join in that view. I am seeing agreement on that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Albas. , \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would like to focus on two things.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 First of all, our member from the Bloc Qu?b?cois asked specifically about the subcommittee and whether or not it should be deciding on our times. I do think that discussion needs to be at the subcommittee. If we decide to go with the 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. slot?I'm not on the subcommittee, but I want to give my opinion?I think that will work. Being from British Columbia, I travel a long distance to be here. I will be here for those. I think it's a good step for the committee.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Second, though, if there are exceptional requirements for further meetings at further times, just due to the nature of some of the people we will be working with, in order to make sure we can accommodate?again, it's written in the motion?many of the public figures who may need to have different time slots, I'm prepared to work. Parliament, I think, is prepared to work. I'd like to see that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I did note today, Mr. Chair, that we were able to come up with unanimous support for my colleague's motion. I think that's a good first step, but I will say this. Again, the member from Quebec has mentioned that the ambassador will be in North America?as I mentioned earlier, he will be in Houston on January 28?and if the ambassador can be making public comments in Houston or talking and doing his job in North America on the 28th, to me there's no reason why the ambassador cannot be here for a period of time either before or after.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I don't think that we should, as Mr. Barrett said earlier, wait until the very last date. There are a number of issues that are very pertinent and are time sensitive. I have interviewed the ambassador at committee and have found that he's very capable of dealing with parliamentarians. I don't believe he'll require a lot of time to be briefed up. I think he'll be able to come here and give us answers. I do want to push the government to try to make that sooner rather than later, for the good of this committee and for this Parliament's work", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Doherty', " \n\xa0\nMr. Todd Doherty: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, I am going to echo some comments along the lines of those of Mr. Albas and then bring up what Mr. Bergeron mentioned. If the ambassador is going to be back in North America, in Houston, there's no reason why he could not be appearing before this committee.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We have two Canadians who are being detained. To the comments of Lenore, our colleague across the floor, we should be moving forward, always, with them. We also have farmers who can't wait. They've suffered significant losses due to the trade action from this government. I think that as a committee we should be moving forward and trying to have the ambassador here at his earliest convenience", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Alleslev', ' \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to echo what Mr. Oliphant said about those who so tragically lost their lives. Unfortunately, my riding was one of the ones that were quite significantly hit. It has really had a substantive impact. I want to send out, if I might?on behalf of all of us, I know?my condolences to everyone who has suffered as a result of this tragedy', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Ms. Alleslev.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Bergeron, you have the floor', " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Might I suggest that, once we have finished committee business, perhaps we should observe a minute of silence?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We could observe a minute of silence now.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0[The committee observes a moment of silence.][English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Colleagues, I've asked the clerk to reach out to the members of the subcommittee to work out the time as soon as possible for its first meeting. I hope that can take place very soon.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is there anything further?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Seeing nothing, I thank the committee for its work today.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This meeting is adjourned.]"]
['[\n\xa0\nThe Chair (Hon. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.)): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Colleagues, this meeting of the Special Committee on Canada-China Relations will come to order.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Bergeron, you have something to say, I think', ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron (Montarville, BQ): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, Mr.\xa0Chair. I wanted to know the status of the translation of the document that I am still waiting for after our last meeting', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It is done, and the document will be delivered to your office today', ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0And none too soon. Thank you', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Actually, that's very good timing.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr.\xa0Bergeron, because your comments gave us time to receive the cards with our names on them. So today's witnesses will be able to see who we are. [English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Colleagues, the first hour of this meeting will be with the officials on the bilateral relationship and the second hour with the officials on trade. There will be 10-minute opening remarks for each panel and, of course, each will be followed by a round of questions by members.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This morning we have, from the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development, Marta Morgan, deputy minister, foreign affairs; Paul Thoppil, assistant deputy minister, Asia Pacific; and Cindy Termorshuizen, director general, international security policy bureau.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Please proceed, Ms. Morgan", " \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan (Deputy Minister, Foreign Affairs, Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair and members of the committee. My colleagues and I are very grateful today to have the opportunity to give you some background on China and Canada's relationship with it.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Let me start by acknowledging the preoccupation that I know we all have with the coronavirus outbreak in China and the impact this is having on Canadians. The safety and well-being of Canadians at home and abroad is of paramount importance to the Government of Canada. Canada is deeply concerned by the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus, particularly regarding its potential impacts on Canadians in the Wuhan area. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Global Affairs Canada is working closely with the Public Health Agency of Canada and supporting their engagement with Chinese health officials to provide a timely and coordinated response to the outbreak. Some 156 Canadian citizens have contacted Global Affairs Canada for departure assistance. The government has secured a chartered aircraft and is now working on the diplomatic front with officials in China to obtain the authorizations to proceed with an assisted departure.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This latest crisis is occurring after a long period of instability in Hong Kong and, as you are well aware, a difficult year in Canada-China relations. Canada's relations with China are complex, with both opportunities and challenges. Now more than ever, Canadians are asking questions about what China's economic growth and governance model means for their future prosperity, their security and Canada's place in the world. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The committee is taking on important work at a crucial time. A common understanding of where the People's Republic of China is going and how it touches Canada's national interests will make our policy better. The committee will decide what issues to examine in closer detail and will have the opportunity to hear a wide variety of views from experts and stakeholders. Ambassador Dominic Barton, whom you will meet next week, will provide an excellent view from the ground in Beijing.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The governments of Canada and China have, or at least had until the end of 2018, close ties in a number of areas. Few government departments or agencies do not have a partnership with their counterparts in China, in one form or another, and do not have a mandate in which China occupies a major place. Global Affairs Canada is taking a lead role in coordinating the Government of Canada's approach to China, in order to ensure that our relationships are consistent.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I am here to present a general background, which I invite you to consider when you are establishing your program.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 For many years, citizens of Canada and the People's Republic of China have built bridges between our countries. While October 2020 will mark 50 years since we established diplomatic ties, many years before that Canadian missionaries helped found leading medical schools in China, and Canada traded wheat to stave off famine across China in the early days of the People's Republic.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It is remarkable that Canada and Canadians, despite our ideological differences, reached out across the Pacific to support the people of China even without an embassy to support them. With the founding of diplomatic relations, Canada launched a broad official relationship, including a bilateral aid program that wound down in 2013.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Through our aid and engagement, Canada supported China's modernization and opening up. Canadians made substantial contributions to reform in the non-profit, legal, educational and agricultural systems over the decades. For example, Canadian programming helped Chinese farmers adapt to the WTO as China completed a accession process. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Reform was critical to China's success in alleviating poverty. According to the World Bank, China has lifted 850 million people out of poverty. China's poverty rate fell from 88% in 1981 to 0.7% in 2015. In 2018 China's GDP was 174 times the size it was in 1952, and per capita annual income had surpassed $10,000 U.S.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As China's economy opened and grew, Canadian trade and investment in China did as well. China is now Canada's third-largest trading partner after the U.S. and the EU.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0While still only accounting for roughly 5% of Canadian exports, Canada's trade with China has grown rapidly in recent years. In 2018 two-way merchandise trade between Canada and China reached $103.2 billion, including $27.6 billion in Canadian exports and $75.6 billion in imports.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As my colleague Steve Verheul will explain in the next session, Canadian exports to China fell in 2019. Canada exports mostly raw materials to China under the direct oversight of the Chinese government. As we have been able to see, Canadian exports of canola can be vulnerable to interventions from the Chinese government, interventions that contravene international rules and standards. \xa0\xa0(0940)\xa0\xa0\n\n[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Our commercial relations with China have grown not only in exchange of goods, but more broadly. In 2018 service exports to China were valued at $7.4 billion, while imports from China were valued at $2.8 billion, a 6.1% year-on-year increase in two-way services trade.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 China is Canada's third-largest source of tourists and its second-largest source of international students to Canada.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0But as China's market grew, so did competition for access to it, and China itself has become more competitive. China's economy now accounts for nearly one third of global growth each year. Even at modest rates for China of 6% annual growth, China adds the equivalent of an Australia to its economy every year.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0China has enormous potential to contribute to resolving common global challenges. Indeed, when it comes to global problems such as climate change and health, China, by virtue of its population and economic weight, will continue to play a significant role in tackling our collective problems.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As a permanent member of the UN Security Council and an increasingly important economic and military power, China's influence on Canada's international security priorities cannot be ignored. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On December 10, 2019, Parliament passed the motion establishing this special committee to examine all aspects of the Canada-China relationship. December 10 is also International Human Rights Day, and December 10 is also the day in 2018 when Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were detained arbitrarily by authorities of the People's Republic of China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0December 10, 2018, is a day that changed Canada's outlook on its relations with China. Canada and many of our partners were shocked and saddened by the detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We condemn arbitrary detentions and sentencing. Coercive practices, especially those that target innocent individuals for political ends, undermine the norms and principles that are the foundation of international relations. International partners have also condemned the detention and the practice of residential surveillance at a designated location that falls outside of any recognized judicial process for many detained in China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We have also raised concern about the failure to recognize the residual immunities of Michael Kovrig, who is a colleague and friend for many in Global Affairs Canada. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0These detentions reflect broader features of China's governance that pose challenges to human rights and the rule of law: the Communist Party's increasingly authoritarian grip on power; restrictions on civic freedoms in Hong Kong and abuses of human rights in Xinjiang; coercive diplomacy against individuals and countries that threaten the Chinese government's interests; and threats to democracy and democratic institutions.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Government of Canada has not shied away from disagreements with the Government of the People's Republic. We have called at every opportunity for the immediate release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, as well as clemency for Robert Schellenberg and all death penalty cases.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As an absolute priority for the Government of Canada, Canadian officials have worked tirelessly to advocate for these cases bilaterally and multilaterally, while remaining consistent in our policy approach to bilateral relations with China. [Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We have always indicated our deep concern with the restrictions on the rights and freedoms of the Uighurs and other Muslim minorities. We do so both in our bilateral relations and in multilateral forums such as the Human Rights Council. We have asked the Chinese authorities to respect the freedom of religion of all Chinese citizens in Xinjiang and in Tibet, whatever their faith?Muslim, Christian, Buddhist or practitioners of Falung Gong. We have also asked them to put an end to the efforts to silence those standing up for human rights.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We have argued in favour of Taiwan's genuine participation in international forums where international action is needed, such as the World Health Organization.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On these issues, Canada is not alone. Like-minded partners have added their voices to call for the release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor and an end to arbitrary detention. Canada enjoys the good company of many democratic nations in our call for an end to human rights abuses in China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 In the face of these challenges, however, we must also recognize our deep people-to-people ties, including the nearly two million Canadians of Chinese descent. Exchanges take place not just between governments, but between companies, students, tourists, artists and athletes. Governments play a facilitating role in these people-to-people exchanges, which are an important foundation for progress.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Looking forward, the relations with China will continue to be complex, and Canada will need to chart a path that allows us to protect Canada's interests, to work with China on issues of mutual benefit and to continue to press for justice and human rights. \xa0\xa0(0945)\xa0\xa0\n\n[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Canadian businesses will benefit from the growth of the Chinese economy, which will become the biggest in the world, and from an increasing role in the value chain for goods and services.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Whether we are involved in global solutions to climate change, financial systems, or pandemics, we have to rely on participation from China. Multilateral cooperation begins with the creation of solid bilateral relationships. [English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Canada needs to enhance our understanding of China, not only to adapt to the opportunities it presents, but also to better defend the core values of democracy, human rights and freedoms that Canadians enjoy at home and abroad. This can only happen, I believe, with enhanced people-to-people ties and ongoing engagement, all of which starts with the return of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor and clemency for Robert Schellenberg.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The work of this committee presents an important opportunity to review all aspects of the Canada-China relationship and to chart a path forward that takes into account both risks and opportunities.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I wish you much success in this important work.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I will be pleased to answer your questions", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Ms.\xa0Morgan.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We will start the round with Ms.\xa0Alleslev', " \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev (Aurora?Oak Ridges?Richmond Hill, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for being here and for recognizing just how critical at this point in the global world?as well as our own?the Canada-China relationship is. You gave a great overview, but I'm wondering if we could specifically target this to an understanding of exactly what actions have occurred in the last 14 months, namely, what direction you've been given by the government and what actions you have taken over the last 14 months to prevent the further decline of Canada's relationship with the People's Republic of China", " \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Let me say that over the past 14 months our priority has been to resolve a number of the challenging issues that have arisen in our relationship with the People's Republic of China, starting with the detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. The Government of Canada is deeply concerned by the arbitrary detention and arrest by Chinese authorities of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor and we continue to call for their immediate release.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We have worked very closely at all levels to convey these messages to the Government of China, most recently in a meeting in Japan between Minister Champagne and his counterpart, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, shortly after Minister Champagne became foreign minister. We have engaged many other countries to assist us in making these representations. Fourteen other countries have supported us publicly, and even more privately", " \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Can I ask you about this on that front? Fourteen countries have agreed to support us publicly. That's fantastic, and we want their support?no question?but what specific action have you taken to translate that support into quantifiable action? Specifically, what are they doing in terms of actions to make that support...and have the arbitrary detention withdrawn?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, the countries that have engaged in support with us have made both public and private representations at many levels to the Government of China on these issues.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 In addition to this, I would also like to discuss the trade side a little bit, because that has been one issue that has emerged in the last 14 months, if the chair would permit", " \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That would be great, because in actual fact we understand that our largest ally and partner, the United States, is currently signing an agreement with China, yet we haven't seen any action by way of support for Canada on the arbitrary detention issue. Can you speak to that, please?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Absolutely. The Government of the United States has spoken out against the arbitrary detention of Mr. Spavor and Mr. Kovrig, Mr. Chair. There have been resolutions in the House of Representatives, for example, decrying the detention of these two individuals. All of our allies?, \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 But actions speak louder than words, so what specific actions...? Certainly, not signing a trade agreement when that would have been a prime opportunity.... Are we concerned with our relationship with the U.S", ' who is perhaps not advocating the way we need them to on this issue?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, the United States is as concerned as we are with the arbitrary detention and arrest by Chinese authorities of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor. It has supported us both publicly and privately through diplomatic channels in making representations to the Government of China about this arbitrary detention and arbitrary conditions?, \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Would you say that progress has been made as a result?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, this is a complicated issue, clearly. It involves delicate diplomatic relationships. It is not entirely within the control, as you would know, of the Government of Canada. We have made best efforts across a variety of diplomatic channels and working with our allies, including the United States, to put pressure on the Government of China around the arbitrary detention and arrest of these individuals, as well as to seek clemency for Mr. Schellenberg', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You have one minute', " \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You were going to mention the trade aspects and how we are utilizing the trade aspects to also improve our relationship with China. Can you speak to that?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Let me just say that in the trade aspects of the relationship, as you're aware, the current canola seeds market issue with the Government of China has had a big impact on Canadian farmers. The Government of Canada is taking action through the rule of law and the processes that exist to resolve these problems", " \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You've already outlined how they're not necessarily abiding by the rule of law, so what recourse do we have when they're not playing by the rules as specified?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You have about six seconds for the answer", ' \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Canada will continue to pursue this through the WTO, which is the established mechanism to resolve trade disputes. That reinforces our commitment to the rule of law and to using established processes to resolve these disputes', ' \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Colleagues, there are two sides to this. On the one hand, I'd like to ask members to allow the witnesses to answer the questions. At the same time, I'd like to ask the witnesses to try to be concise and focus their answers on the questions asked.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Next we have Mr. Fragiskatos", " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos (London North Centre, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, witnesses, for being here and for all the work you are doing on this issue, which is beyond complicated, to be frank.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Deputy Minister, although she didn't elaborate on it, I believe my colleague was criticizing the government for not going ahead and signing a free trade agreement with China, which in her view would have made getting over the current impasse that Canada finds itself in?the current challenges?easier. How long do free trade agreements take to negotiate, especially when thinking about a country like China?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, my colleague Steve Verheul will be very well placed to give more detail on trade agreements, but I would just say that they generally take quite a while to negotiate, and particularly where the partner is a complicated and a large partner, such as China is for Canada", " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I will certainly be putting that question to Mr. Verheul as well. However, I think it's fair to say that it would take longer than three or four years. Is that...?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Depending on the country involved and the complexity of issues, it could easily take that long", " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There is also a context here, I think, that you alluded to in your remarks, but I wonder if you could go into that. We're dealing with a superpower. Canada is a middle power. There's also another superpower?obviously, the United States?which has ongoing disagreements on a range of issues vis-?-vis the Chinese. Canada, it seems, is caught in the middle. Our position as a middle power conditions or dictates our foreign policy choices on a good day, but especially when we're caught in-between these two great powers, I think this obviously has a lot to play. It really is important to pay attention to that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Can you go into, Deputy Minister, the challenges of Canada's navigating what is, really, a difficult time in the relations between the U.S. and China as well?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 There's been a lot written about the strategic rivalry between a status quo power and an emerging power. This might make a great future study for the committee. There are many views to take into account. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As a middle power, Canada has relied strongly on international rules and norms in institutions, and to protect businesses and our economic interests, as well as to promote peace and stability. We believe that is the strongest framework within which we can operate as a middle power", " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Canada is not unique among liberal democracies in facing challenges with the Chinese government. Is that correct?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, that is absolutely correct. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You will see during your investigation by the committee, I'm sure, Mr. Chair, that a number of countries have had challenges in their relationship with China. In many cases, these challenges can take quite a while to resolve. , \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Although we did hear about it in the questioning by Ms. Alleslev, can you go into the building of a coalition by the Canadian government to engage like-minded countries?liberal democracies in particular?when it comes to this issue? Can you speak to how important that is and how that was cultivated? Putting together that kind of effort, that sort of partnership, doesn't happen overnight. That happens over time, and I think that over time it can yield very good results. Can you speak to that?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, Mr. Chair. We have really benefited from the support and strength of many like-minded countries on this issue.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 This has required a significant effort at all levels of the Government of Canada, starting with the Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and all of our officials, both here in Ottawa and in Beijing. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Paul has just informed me that over the last year and a bit we made over 1,000 d?marches to other countries in order to secure support for us and Mr. Spavor and Mr. Kovrig. You can see that our efforts have been very intense and at all levels and that countries really came forward of their own volition as well, because this is recognized as a particularly challenging situation and very inappropriate", " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have about one minute left. With so many Canadians concerned about the coronavirus, I think you've seen the government respond very quickly and in a very organized fashion when it comes to this. You did speak to this in your remarks, but can you elaborate once more on what exactly the Canadian government is doing to bring Canadians home from China and to ensure their safety once they arrive in Canada?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Public Health Agency of Canada has the lead in coordinating the domestic efforts to manage the outbreak of the coronavirus. Global Affairs Canada is focusing on the well-being of Canadians in China and travel advice and also on the well-being of our consular and diplomatic staff.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As Minister Champagne announced yesterday, the Government of Canada has reserved a plane to repatriate Canadians from Wuhan, which is at the epicentre of China's coronavirus. We will be working with the Public Health Agency of Canada, Health Canada and our American colleagues to ensure that Canadians here are protected upon the return of those individuals and that things are handled appropriately from a public health perspective", " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's a coordinated response.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Fragiskatos. [Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The floor now goes to Mr.\xa0Bergeron", " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr.\xa0Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would like to welcome our witnesses and thank them for that presentation. I confess in all sincerity?and I do not say this pejoratively?that I was expecting a statement that was a little more syrupy and full of generalities, having heard that Chinese authorities must be following the appearance this morning very attentively. So my thanks to you for your presentation.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Just now, a comparison was made between the difficulties that Canada is currently experiencing with the People?s Republic of China and the difficulties that other western democracies could be experiencing with the same country. I am not sure that this is a good basis for comparison.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Traditionally, in fact, Canada has developed excellent relations with the People?s Republic of China more quickly than other western democracies. This may be because of the influence of a man like Norman Bethune, because of the food aid that you mentioned in your presentation, or because of the involvement of the father of the current Prime Minister. Canada's relations with the People?s Republic of China have always been excellent, until the unfortunate episode involving the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, which made Canada the battlefield for two superpowers in their negotiations with each other.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The American government?s involvement seems interesting to me. Whatever the good intentions, the Americans always first and foremost defend their own interests, not ours, in the negotiations that they are currently conducting with China. As a consequence, I believe that they have used Canada for their own interests by demanding that Meng Wanzhou be arrested and extradited to the United States. President Trump confirmed as much a few days ago when he stated that all that would be needed to drop the demand to extradite Meng Wanzhou is an agreement with China. That highlights the difficulty in which we find ourselves at the moment.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I am going to ask my questions all at once, because I know that they keep track of our time.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You emphasize that the Communist Party?s control over China as a state is constantly increasing. This despite the fact that Canada has modified its traditional position towards China, a position that always focussed on the question of human rights. During the 1990s, Canada decided to put more emphasis on the development of trade relations. That approach had considerable success, as you mentioned. But we can clearly see that it had very little positive effect on the human rights situation. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Given the hold that the Communist Party has on China as a state, let me first ask you this question. Are Canada?s relations limited to China as a state or are we also trying to develop relations with the Communist Party? \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My second question is about the arrest of Meng Wanzhou. Given that she is accused of breaking United States sanctions against Iran, sanctions that Canada does not even apply, what justified that arrest? I know that the matter is now before the courts and that unfortunately it is no longer possible to respond politically, which immediately rules out the possibility of a prisoner exchange. Such an exchange would damage Canada?s assertion that we are governed by the rule of law, not to mention that it would invite any other country in the world to imprison Canadians in that kind of manoeuvre.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0How do you explain the impact of having no Canadian ambassador in Beijing for those months? Does it not prove to the Chinese authorities that, basically, the arrest of the two Michaels is not that important for the Canadian government, which has left the ambassador?s residence vacant for several months during this crisis?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms.\xa0Morgan, you have a minute and fifteen seconds for your answer", ' \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay, I will try to answer all the questions.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First, I agree that our relations with China have been excellent for a number of years, and we have always had good face-to-face relationships. In the field of trade, we have many very complex relationships that require contacts. We are developing the relationships at all levels of Chinese society and government. China is a major country in the world and the relationships that we have with them are very important for us all.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Now I will answer the question about Meng Wanzhou.\xa0\xa0(1005)\xa0\xa0\n\n[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Canada is abiding by its international legal obligations in this case. We are working in accordance with the Extradition Act and our bilateral extradition treaty with the United States. I believe the committee will be receiving briefings by Department of Justice officials on these matters as early as next week. This proceeding is currently before the Supreme Court of B.C. and it will be up to an independent judge to resolve', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Now we have Mr. Harris', " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris (St. John's East, NDP): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I want to thank the witnesses for their very thorough presentation.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The relationship with China is I think a fairly long-lasting one, of course, to the extent that Canada was among the first to help with the recognition of China and to bring it into international relations in a different way. One would assume that we have built a very strong relationship over the many years, with 50 years coming up.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In that context, I'm a little concerned that China's ambassador to Canada back in May spoke of the relationship as being at a ?freezing point? and was concerned that Canada ought to respect China's major concerns and ?stop the moves that undermine the interests of China?. It seems to me to be a rather aggressive statement, given the context of the relations with Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor and the other issues, such as the tariff put on Canadian goods and the stopping of canola and other goods.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0How do you see that kind of statement? Do you know what they're saying when they say ?stop the moves that undermine the interests of China?? Is it something that concerns you that they would take that view?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, I cannot speak, obviously, for the Government of China, but clearly they have taken a very strong public position in the case of Madam Meng, and that public position has been quite firm. I would invite you to invite our ambassador to China to Canada to seek further insight into the views of the Government of China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What I can tell you is that we are very concerned with the current situation, and particularly with the arbitrary detention and arrest by Chinese authorities of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, of course, we all are, and it's probably one of the motivating forces that got this committee going in the first place.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to ask you about the efforts that have been made. You've indicated that over 1,000 d?marches have been issued by Canada.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I find the number of 14 countries that are supporting Canada to be disappointingly low. You've indicated that they have come forward of their own volition. Does that mean we are not constantly seeking support from other countries? What is the strategy here? , \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, we are constantly seeking support from other countries. I'll pass this question on to Mr. Thoppil to provide more context and detail on that", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Paul Thoppil (Assistant Deputy Minister, Asia Pacific, Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There are a number of countries that have publicly expressed...and a number that have expressed a desire to do so in a private bilateral way with China. Therefore, in total, we take great comfort with the number of countries in totality that have indicated in their engagement with?, \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0How many would that be?, \n\xa0\nMr. Paul Thoppil: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There is quite a number. We can give you a list afterwards if the committee would prefer, but besides countries, there is the Secretary General of NATO, there is the EU and there are the G7 foreign ministers, who have all, in addition to those 14 countries, publicly committed an expression of disappointment and consternation with the arbitrary detention of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig', " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is there any additional strategy other than a public or private expression of concern?, \n\xa0\nMr. Paul Thoppil: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As Deputy Morgan indicated previously, those are sensitive diplomatic relations that are being done, and I think that in the context of these public proceedings and with the desire to ensure the protection of the individuals concerned, I would not like to elaborate further. , \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I don't wish to unfairly contrast one detention versus the other, but is there any additional leverage that applies, given the fact that one of these individuals is in fact a Canadian diplomat on leave? Does that offer any additional ability to put pressure on China to become more sensitive to not just Mr. Kovrig's detention but the entire approach? Is that of any assistance at all?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, I can assure you that one issue we have raised consistently with the Government of China is the residual diplomatic immunities of Mr. Michael Kovrig, who was one of our colleagues at Global Affairs Canada", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would think that other countries?most other countries, not just 14 or whatever number you have on your side?would be concerned about that, too. That's something that interferes with international relations generally in dealing with a country like China, assuming that China wants to be part of the world community", " \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Diplomatic immunities are a very important part of being able to engage in the very important bilateral relationships that we have around the world and that all countries have around the world with other countries. It's very important to be protected. It's very important for those relationships to be able to exist and to be safe. I think there's general and widespread agreement on that, Mr. Chair", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Harris.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Warkentin', " \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin (Grande Prairie?Mackenzie, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, and I appreciate all of the witnesses coming. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Of course, we're trying to better understand the government's view of the relationship between Canada and the United States. We understand that it's complex. I think the vast majority of Canadians understand that it's complex. I think you'd forgive Canadians for wondering whether we're moving into the incoherent point in time. Canadians do want clarity with regard to the government's current position.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Thoppil, you made national news last summer when it was revealed that you had reached out to two former ambassadors to ask them to run future communications through the department so that they would not speak freely but would run their communications through the department. What prompted you to make those calls?, \n\xa0\nMr. Paul Thoppil: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In my capacity, and that of all of my colleagues at Global Affairs, we are constantly engaging with former heads of mission and retired foreign service officers in countries because they bring a valuable source of knowledge and expertise?, \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It was reported that you had instruction to do that. Who instructed you to make those calls?, \n\xa0\nMr. Paul Thoppil: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As I said before, we initiate on our own, as part of our stakeholder engagement?, \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I ask for you to bear with me. I have only five minutes, and I have several questions. Were you given instruction to make those calls?, \n\xa0\nMr. Paul Thoppil: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 As I said before, I engage and I continue to engage with former heads of mission to get that input", " \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Do you do it without instruction?, \n\xa0\nMr. Paul Thoppil: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's unfortunate that in that exchange, with the intent to exchange on complex issues to better inform and keep former heads of mission and former diplomats abreast of current circumstances, there was a clear misunderstanding and communication in that regard. There was, at no time, any pressure put on officials to prevent any former Canadian diplomat from speaking freely and publicly. In fact, we welcome their input, and we welcome that input to us directly and in a public manner", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0So you were not instructed by anybody to make those calls? That was regular communication from your office', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Paul Thoppil: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As I said before, I continue of my own volition to engage with former heads of mission to seek their input and feedback because they are a rich source of intelligence for us', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Your intention was just to hear from them, not to convey any messages', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Paul Thoppil: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As I said, we need their input as long as we engage with academia and business for the development of the advice that we give to ministers of the government', " \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Would you be able to provide your notes from that time frame to this committee?, \n\xa0\nMr. Paul Thoppil: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm sorry?, \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Would you have taken notes during those phone calls?, \n\xa0\nMr. Paul Thoppil: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0No, there were no notes taken", " \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In terms of the 14 countries, there have been statements made that, of course, we have been undertaking an effort to build some alliances with other countries. The incoherence comes from this: In October of 2019 Canada sent a delegation of soldiers to engage in military games in China. As a matter of fact, it was during the election campaign. This was at the same time, of course, that Canada was seeking to negotiate the release of the Michaels, but China's embassy saw the delegation coming to China differently maybe from how your department may have. As a matter of fact, Beijing's embassy said that Canada's military having sent a big delegation to China was more evidence that the Asian power was not losing friends. As a matter of fact, they viewed that as a demonstration that Canada was developing a stronger relationship with it.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Were there any concerns with regard to sending that delegation? What was the intended message of sending that delegation?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mr. Chair, as the most populous country in the world and the second-largest economy, China plays a role in almost all issues of interest to Canada. The relationship is complicated. It is multi-variable. We have strong person-to-person ties; we have strong trade relationships, and we will continue to engage with China on multiple fronts while we work very hard to resolve the bilateral challenges that we have in front of us. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You have only 10 seconds. , \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I don't think that answers my question.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Why did Canada send that delegation at a time when things were so sensitive, when it was clearly a demonstration of friendship at a time that you have already described as being one when things had worsened, when the relationship had changed? Why was that decision made?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Be very brief", ' \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, there have been many visits and many relations that have been pursued with China over the course of this time period. We continue to build relationships in the areas where we can work together with China and where we can work to our mutual benefit while continuing to put a focus on resolving both the personal and the trade issues in front of us, which are serious. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Mr. Warkentin.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Zann', " \n\xa0\nMs. Lenore Zann (Cumberland?Colchester, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Deputy Minister, for your testimony today.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In your remarks, you paint a really complex picture of China and Canada's relationship with China. As my colleague from the Bloc Qu?b?cois also noted, all of the help that Canada has been to China is very important in our relationship, in relationship-building and in helping to work across the waves with folks on the other side of the ocean when they were struggling. Now it's nice to see that they are doing well.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My question for you is regarding the human rights issue. We know that Islamophobia has been rising around the world and it's very concerning for many of us. The Uighurs in particular are on the minds of many of us. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm just wondering what, in particular, our government is doing to try to help them by talking with our partners in China about the detention of Uighurs as well as the detention of our Canadians. , \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Canada raises human rights concerns at every opportunity and at every level. Our advocacy for human rights in China includes bilateral dialogue, joint or unilateral public statements, interventions in multilateral forums such as the Human Rights Council of the United Nations, monitoring and reporting, outreach, and participation in events that raise awareness and support communities whose rights are at stake. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0For example, our mission reporting from Beijing and our outreach with Uighur communities inform our approach and our understanding of the issues and abuses that are happening in Xinjiang. Those efforts include making joint statements with other countries.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would like to reinforce that we have had a very consistent approach to these issues. We raise our concerns on a wide range of human rights violations and we encourage others to join us at every opportunity we have. , \n\xa0\nMs. Lenore Zann: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The cultural past of China is very rich and very deep, so is the current impasse in our negotiations regarding the two Michaels and Robert Schellenberg affecting our relationship with cultural exchanges? \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Also, how do you see culture and sports as a way of bringing us together and trying to continue to create a strong alliance?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think this goes to a broader question, which is that there are many promising areas for us to engage in constructively with China. Culture and sports are clearly two of those, but we also share many other common interests. A growing middle class of consumers in China, for example, seeks high-quality health products from Canada. There is an opportunity there for some of our cultural industries as well to exchange with China and to build understanding and build bridges between us.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Whether it's sports or students or exchanges, we have many opportunities to build mutual understanding between Canada and China and also to work together on tackling challenging issues that will require the active participation of China in order to make headway. , \n\xa0\nMs. Lenore Zann: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You mentioned that climate change is something that China is also working very carefully to try to help us halt. Can you elaborate a little more on that? \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Are the two countries working together on any specific projects to deal with climate change?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, I would put climate change in that category of issues where China, obviously, being the world's second-largest economy with 1.4 billion people, needs to play a very constructive role. Canada has engaged China on environmental issues and climate change for many years. We co-hosted a meeting with China and the EU on climate change recently. We continue to engage with them at all levels on that issue, which is so important to all of us", ' \n\xa0\nMs. Lenore Zann: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much. I appreciate that', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's all your time, Ms. Zann.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Williamson", " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson (New Brunswick Southwest, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to our witnesses for being here today.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Morgan, I have just one quick question. How many Uighurs does your department estimate are currently being detained in the People's Republic of China?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would have to get back to you on that question", ' \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could you provide that number to the committee, please?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes', " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Does the department have a country strategy on the People's Republic of China? If so, could that be tabled with this committee?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As the most populous country in the world and the second-largest economy, China plays a role in almost all issues that are of interest to us. It's a complicated relationship. It has opportunities and challenges. We manage it in a multi-faceted way with domestic, bilateral and international considerations", " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Is there a country strategy on the People's Republic of China, and could you table it with this committee by February 3?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'd be happy to provide more information to the committee about our approach to addressing the many challenges and opportunities with China", " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0How do you propose doing that?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm happy to provide more information on our approach. It's just?, \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could we have the China strategy?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0?that on issue of a ?country strategy?, I'm not sure we would use that terminology, but we're happy to provide more information on our overall approach to China and the various aspects of it. , \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could you table that document?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We will be happy to provide more information on that, yes", ' \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0By February 3...?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When is February 3? Next week?, \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes', " \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We'll provide that as soon as possible. Let me get back to you on the timing", " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0All right. The ambassador's in next week, so before that", " \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, that's understood", ' \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Do you have a global power strategy that you could table with this committee, a strategy that would look at China, Russia, the United States...?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We do not have a pre-written global power strategy', " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could you table, by the end of the day on February 3, a record of all ministerial travel to China since 2015?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm happy to look into that. We'll also look into how quickly we can provide it. That could be a little complicated to pull together", " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You mentioned in your remarks?I'm not sure if it was the government, Canada or you?that you were shocked and saddened by the detention of the two Canadian citizens. ?Saddened? surprises me. What about ?outraged??, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We have been very clear on this matter that the arbitrary detention of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor is unacceptable, and it is our top priority to resolve this issue. , \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Would you call them hostages?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Spavor and Mr. Kovrig have been arbitrarily detained by the Government of China", " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0They've been.... Pardon me?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0They've been arbitrarily detained", " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Arbitrarily, but not illegally...?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0They've been arbitrarily detained", ' \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0So it was an accident. It kind of just happened', ' \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0No', " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What do you mean by ?arbitrarily??, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think I've been very clear on this issue that the Government of Canada is very deeply concerned by the arbitrary detention and arrest by Chinese authorities of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. We have been working tirelessly to address this issue", ' \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0All right.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Do you really believe the United States government is equally concerned about the detention of two Canadians and that it would be taking the same posture if it were two Americans? Are they as equally concerned about this as we are?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mr. Chair, the United States government is very concerned about the arbitrary detention of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig and has been consistently supportive of our position on this issue. , \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Thoppil, yes or no, were you instructed to make that outreach my colleague referred to? , \n\xa0\nMr. Paul Thoppil: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I initiate and I engage with former heads of missions every day', " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. Thank you. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm going to give my last 15 seconds to my colleague", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, you can', " \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'd like to state for the record that at no time did I suggest that Canada should have a free trade deal with China to resolve the consular cases. That was not what I said, so I want to make sure the record says that", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I make it 10:28 in 10 seconds, so I'll give you a minute and a half, Mr. Oliphant", " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant (Don Valley West, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Chair, and thank you to the officials.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for your work on this complex thing. When I look at these trouble spots in the world, there is a tool kit of interventions that can be done, from ?extreme? to ?nothing?. It would seem to me that Canada has chosen a middle road in our interventions, which are strong but are keeping the door open for diplomatic engagement. We have not done certain extreme activities that some in the opposition have called for, nor have we simply laid down and said that nothing is going on.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is that a correct understanding of the approach that we're having at this time?, \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, I think that is a reasonable interpretation of our approach.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We need to act firmly. We have condemned the actions of the Government of China, both in terms of arbitrary detention and in terms of trade actions.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 That being said, we have diplomatic relations with the Government of China and we need to use those relationships to advance our interests and to seek resolution to the problems we have", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for your appearance today. You are now excused.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0While we're waiting for the next set of witnesses, and before I let you go ahead, Mr. Harris, if you don't mind, I just want to inform the committee that members have been calling the clerk to try to find out what the committee's regular time slot would be. That has been difficult, because there hasn't been a time when everyone can be available. We may have to come to the point when we choose a time despite the fact that not everyone is available for that time. Perhaps at the end of this meeting, if we have time, we can take a moment to discuss this.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Second, in terms of upcoming meetings, as members may know, on Tuesday, February 4 from 10 to noon we'll have a briefing with consular affairs and Justice. On Wednesday, February 5, from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m", " we'll have a briefing with Ambassador Barton.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Harris. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Jack Harris: On a point of order, I just wanted to?, \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could I ask that we suspend the meeting for a moment so the witnesses may leave and we can allow the table?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I've already indicated that the witnesses are excused. , \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It would be the normal custom for us to suspend for a moment so we could thank the witnesses?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Jack Harris: Mr. Chairman, I have a point of order", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would like to hear from Mr. Harris on his point of order', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This is relevant to the witnesses. I just wanted to confirm that Mr. Thoppil will provide the list of countries to the committee.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think you said you would. That is something we would like you to do, or that I would certainly like you to do. , \n\xa0\nMr. Paul Thoppil: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Agreed', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Morgan, I understand that you want to correct something you said', " \n\xa0\nMs. Marta Morgan: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I was incorrect in my speaking remarks about the number of Canadians seeking assisted departure from Wuhan, which is now at 196. Could we put that on the record? , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The witnesses are excused. I will suspend for a few moments.\xa0\xa0(1030)\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\xa0(1030)\xa0\xa0\n\n, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We are ready to get started if members want to take their seats.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We now have a set of witnesses from the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development: Mr. Steve Verheul, assistant deputy minister, trade policy and negotiations; Mr. Doug Forsyth, director general, market access; Mr. Duane McMullen, director general, trade commissioner service, operations; and, Monsieur Fran?ois Rivest, executive director, Greater China. From the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food, we have Mr. Fred Gorrell, assistant deputy minister, international affairs branch.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Verheul, would you like to begin your presentation? I believe we're going to have10 minutes for opening remarks by the panel", " \n\xa0\nMr. Steve Verheul (Assistant Deputy Minister, Trade Policy and Negotiations, Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you and good morning, Mr. Chair and members of the committee. We are pleased to have this opportunity to update the committee on recent challenges facing the Canada-China trade relationship and ways in which the government is seeking to improve conditions for Canadian exporters. Following my remarks, we would be happy to provide further details and answer any questions you may have.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As you heard earlier, Canada's trade and investment relationship with China has grown substantially as the Chinese economy has developed. China is our third-largest trading partner, accounting for nearly 9% of Canada's trade with the world and about 5% of our total exports in 2018. China is also now the third-largest source of foreign direct investment from Asia into Canada, with the stock of Chinese investment in Canada valued at $16.9 billion in 2018. This growth in bilateral trade and investment led Canada to explore ways to improve the environment for Canadians to do business in the Chinese market over the past decade. However, as you are well aware, the deterioration of Canada-China bilateral relations has affected the policy environment.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0From January to November 2019 our exports to China fell by some 14.7% compared with those in 2018, driven by a drop in the canola seed, wood pulp, and nickel shipments. However, I should point out that part of that was clearly due to the economic slowdown in China as well as to the deteriorating relationship. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It has also changed the way some Canadians do business with China. Some Canadian businesses have reported increased scrutiny of their exports at the border. Others have seen a slowdown in sales as Chinese importers have become reluctant to bear the risk of political uncertainty. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In March of 2019, China suspended shipments from two major Canadian canola seed exporters and increased inspection of all Canadian canola seed exports to China, citing an alleged discovery of pests. This move effectively blocked a large portion of Canada's largest agricultural export to China. Canadian canola seed exports to China have since fallen by around 70%.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Our priority since has been to seek a science-based solution to fully restore market access. We are working closely with the governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as well as with industry partners.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On September 9, 2019, Canada requested formal consultations with China at the World Trade Organization after trying to resolve the issue through bilateral engagement. Those consultations took place on October 28 and provided us with an important opportunity to request further information and clearly voice our concerns with China's restrictive import measures.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0At Canada's request, Canadian technical experts met with Chinese plant specialists in Beijing from December 18 to 20 to discuss China's canola seed quarantine and inspection methodology. We are assessing the information provided by China in order to determine next steps. We expect further technical discussions to take place in the coming months.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The government remains engaged with Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba and with our industry partners through our working group on canola, chaired by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and the Canola Council of Canada. This collaboration will continue to be important as we collectively work to fully restore market access.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It is important to consider, however, that the challenges faced by some Canadian businesses in China are not necessarily new or exclusive to Canada. Since China's accession to the WTO in 2001, many international partners have expressed concerns over certain elements of China's economic and trade policies. These include a variety of issues that affect Canadian exporters. These include a lack of transparency, an inconsistent application of rules and regulations, extensive subsidies for domestic industries, and the large role of state-owned enterprises in the Chinese economy. Nonetheless, China's increasing importance as a consumer market and trading partner continues to present unrivalled new opportunities for business and growth.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This means that we cannot turn our backs and walk away from the trade challenges we face with China. If we do, our competitors will gladly take up Canada's current market share. Indeed, even though political tensions may have affected how some Canadians do business, we will continue to trade, exchange investments, and engage with China. This creates a need for Canada to consider how we engage constructively with China. How do we address barriers to doing business and other concerns while thinking strategically about our trade and investment relationship with China and the rest of the Asia-Pacific region?\xa0\xa0(1040)\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 In this regard, one notable consideration for Canada is the ongoing trade dispute between China and the United States. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Since 2018, China and the United States have engaged in a series of escalating trade actions against one another, including levying tariffs on $455 U.S. billion worth of exports and launching a number of new WTO dispute settlement cases. This fight between the world's two largest economies has fostered uncertainty and put a damper on global economic growth. It has also shifted how countries do business with China, the United States and the rest of the world. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As China and the United States have raised tariffs on each other's goods, they have shifted their exports and imports to other trading partners. Over the past year we have seen China divert its exports away from the United States to Europe, as well as to Vietnam, Korea, Mexico, Australia and Canada. It has also increased its imports from other countries in areas affected by this trade dispute, which has led to new opportunities and increased exports for certain Canadian sectors such as lobster and wheat.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As you are aware, on January 15 China and the United States signed a phase one trade deal intended to address some of the concerns that have led to their trade dispute. The deal includes commitments in areas like agriculture, intellectual property and technology transfer. China pledged, under an unprecedented expanding trade chapter, to restore imports to levels before the trade dispute. It also committed to purchasing an additional 200 billion U.S. dollars' worth of American goods and services over the next two years, a 90% increase over 2017 levels by the end of 2021.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0However, the agreement does not address a number of key concerns for both sides, such as the complete removal of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and structural changes to the Chinese economy, like industrial subsidies and support for state-owned enterprises.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0For Canada and the rest of the world, the phase one deal presents new considerations for our future trade and investment with China and the United States. It presents a challenge to the free and open rules-based trading system by prescribing a managed trade outcome that would likely cause global market distortion and trade diversion effects. This could potentially have negative implications for certain Canadian agricultural sectors that compete with the United States in the Chinese market. On the other hand, the diversion of U.S. exports to China could create opportunities for Canadian businesses to diversify their exports and replace losses in China with the increased market share elsewhere. Similarly, any systemic changes to the Chinese regulatory environment spurred by the deal could benefit Canadians as well.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We are reviewing the agreement and considering the complex web of implications for Canadians. Throughout this process we will continue to work with Canadian stakeholders and our provincial and territorial partners to fully understand the impact of the U.S.-China deal.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In conclusion, Canada's trade with China will evolve as the Chinese economy grows and reforms over time. Our interests and priorities will also shift with major developments in how the world trades and engages with China. That is to say, even as Canada focuses on finding solutions to our own tensions with China, it will be important for us to keep in mind the impacts of changes in other countries' relationships with China on Canadian interests as well.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To echo a point I said earlier, it will be important for Canada to find ways to enhance and leverage our business and people-to-people ties in order to better understand China and advance our bilateral interests. This includes tapping into China's vast economic opportunities while at the same time defending our core values of democracy, human rights and freedoms.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This concludes my opening remarks. We are happy now to answer your questions about Canada-China trade. Thank you very much for your attention", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Warkentin', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Verheul. I appreciate that you and your team are here. I know this is a difficult time for you, as it is for every exporter in the country that exports to China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could you quantify the current trade deficit between Canada and China? Do you have those numbers?, \n\xa0\nMr. Steve Verheul: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We have the current trade deficit. At this point in time, if we look at 2018, our exports to China were worth about $27.6 billion. Our imports from China were $75.6 billion. Obviously, the difference between the two is the deficit', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Right. Those are the 2018 numbers', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Steve Verheul: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That is 2018', " \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Maybe you don't have the current numbers, but I'm wondering, with the current strain in the relationships, specifically with regard to canola, if those have significantly impacted that global number", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Steve Verheul: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, we have seen some drops. We do have data for January to November 2019. We have seen a drop in our merchandise exports by 14.7%. Imports from China have decreased by 0.4%. Our overall bilateral trade has seen a decrease of 4.4%', " \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Obviously, the issue with regard to canola is of major concern to the people I represent. The issue with regard to pork was also a concern to pork producers. The pork issue seemed to be resolved almost magically. It all of a sudden was no longer an issue. I'm sure we didn't see what happened behind closed doors, but it's a lot of people's sense that to fill the consumer market in China, it was necessary for the Chinese to reopen that pork market. It was necessary to meet the demand of the Chinese people. Is that the view of the department?, \n\xa0\nMr. Steve Verheul: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think the issue on pork and beef was more of a legitimate issue surrounding export certificates. We did not see any kind of political interference in that particular issue. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I will ask my colleague Fred Gorrell if he has anything to add to that", " \n\xa0\nMr. Fred Gorrell (Assistant Deputy Minister, International Affairs Branch, Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think it's important to note, as Mr. Verheul said, that there were illegal, illegitimate certificates being used that were not from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and were not relative to Canadian product. Over a period of four months, we provided an exhaustive amount of information to the Chinese to make sure they had complete confidence again in the Canadian system. On November 5 they removed all of the barriers. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Just for context, I think it is important to recognize, as I think people are aware, that China is also working with the African swine fever that has devastated their pork industry there. So there is a huge demand. Clearly, Canadian product is of very good quality and has a very good reputation. They normalized the trade as of November. I can say that since that time, the exports of pork have gone up significantly. It's a very healthy trade", " \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's very good. That is good news.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In regard to canola, obviously canola seed has been identified by the Chinese as being a concern because of an alleged pest. Obviously, that pest wouldn't have an impact on processed canola products. Is there any current limitation on the export of processed products?oil, etc.?from Canada to China?, \n\xa0\nMr. Steve Verheul: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I will let Fred respond to that as well", " \n\xa0\nMr. Fred Gorrell: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's a good question. I'll give a little bit of the context. As Mr. Verheul said, two of our major exporters have been suspended from exporting canola to China, but other companies are allowed to export. When we talk about canola, the key thing is that we're looking at oil, seed, and meal, the three constituents of it. All of them are down, for a number of the reasons that we talked about. They're looking at various pests. We've had a number of visits. I was with the delegation in December. As Mr. Verheul said, we went through what they're looking at from a pest point of view. Our position is as you've identified. Through the processing of canola seed at a processing plant, it would significantly, if not completely, reduce any of the risks they're discussing", " \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The government has tried to assure Canadians that the quarter-billion dollars they sent to China for the Asian infrastructure fund would open new export opportunities and investment opportunities for Canadians into China. Does your department have any evidence that there has been an increase in investment or openness to Canadian investment or exports because of the gift that the Government of Canada gave to China in the form of the quarter-billion dollar investment or gift to the Asian infrastructure bank?, \n\xa0\nMr. Steve Verheul: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'll ask my colleague Fran?ois to respond to that", " \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest (Executive Director, Greater China, Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We don't have any specific examples, but we know that Canadian companies are actively looking at opportunities that might be available through the AIIB, as well as, obviously, the other international financial institutions and the belt and road initiative. Canadian companies are looking for areas where they can benefit from what China is doing to build infrastructure in the region", " \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 But there's no evidence of any expansion of investment?, \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Well, we're speaking to companies that are pursuing opportunities, but I don't have any specific examples", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Warkentin.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Monsieur Dubourg', " \n\xa0\nMr. Emmanuel Dubourg (Bourassa, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr.\xa0Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would like to welcome our guests and thank them for their presentation.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Verheul, you talked about the difficulties Canada faces in its relations with China. You also said that, in trade, the number of food inspections is much greater. You added that those inspections are not only of Canadian products but also of products from other countries.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the wake of the agreement signed with United States, is China keeping up those same inspections with American products?, \n\xa0\nMr. Steve Verheul: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Fred, can I ask you to respond to that?, \n\xa0\nMr. Fred Gorrell: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for that question.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My feeling is that inspections are increasing for all products from all countries, mostly because of the African swine fever. The same may not go for every country. , \n\xa0\nMr. Emmanuel Dubourg: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay, thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We have just been talking about canola, and we know the difficulties we are having there. Is there an increase in the trade with China with other products?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could you talk a little about wood? There is also lobster. Are our wood exports increasing steadily? , \n\xa0\nMr. Steve Verheul: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We have not seen any real impact on our exports of wood and most other products. In fact, we've seen some gains in some products in modest ways. However, out of the ones that have been mentioned, we have not seen a significant drop", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Emmanuel Dubourg: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We are talking about trade here, and, as we know, the coronavirus problem is very recent.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Does that have any repercussions on our trade and our dealings with China? Can you give us a few words about that?, \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It has only been a few weeks since the coronavirus began to become a very significant problem for China. Measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus are increasing each day. Neighbouring countries are closing their borders and flights are being cancelled. The markets are closed in China and movement there is restricted.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Clearly, that will have an impact on international travel, on the ability of Canadians specifically to go to China on business, and on the normal functioning of the Chinese economy. There will indeed be repercussions', " \n\xa0\nMr. Emmanuel Dubourg: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay, thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have one last question. I have just talked about the agreement signed between the Americans and the Chinese. Could you tell me whether Canada can derive any benefit from that agreement?, \n\xa0\nMr. Steve Verheul: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Well, at this point, Mr. Chair, it's still fairly early days. The agreement has not yet come into effect. I think it comes into effect on February 14. We will have to see how the trade actually starts to take place. Much of what China has undertaken to do, in terms of accepting commodity purchases from the U.S", " will tend to open up markets in other countries. We do anticipate that there will be some opportunities created by the U.S.-China agreement, but I think perhaps we'll also see some negative impact on some of our own interests in China", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Emmanuel Dubourg: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You have a minute left', " \n\xa0\nMr. Emmanuel Dubourg: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If you follow the news, you know that we have had no ambassador in China for some time and that Ambassador McCallum was recalled. Could you tell me whether you have seen any improvement in our trade with China since steps have been taken to find his successor? , \n\xa0\nMr. Steve Verheul: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I would think it would be difficult to see a direct relationship between the appointment of the ambassador and an increase or an improvement in the trade situation. I think it's safe to say that we have seen somewhat of an improvement in the relationship, in the sense that we have a dialogue now that we have an ambassador on the ground there. We're hoping that will start to pay dividends in the future as time goes on", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Emmanuel Dubourg: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr.\xa0Dubourg.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The floor is yours, Mr.\xa0Bergeron', " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To add to Mr.\xa0Dubourg's question, I would say that one thing is certain. We may see some positive effects, but we would have seen them more quickly if we had moved more quickly ourselves. Just a comment. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Rivest, I am just curious: what is Greater China?, \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Greater China includes Hong Kong and Taiwan", ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mainland China means China without the neighbouring islands. Greater China includes those islands', ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Does it include the islands that China claims, or is building?, \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Unfortunately, I cannot answer that question', " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Excuse me?, \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I am an expert in trade relations with China, not an expert in China's territorial affairs", ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Fine, but you are the executive director for Greater China. Are those islands part of Greater China?, \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0No, it does not include those territories', " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I know that, at least since the 1970s, we have been involved in an accelerated push to try and increase trade relations with China in the hope that this will bring social and political changes to the country. I know that the second point does not concern us directly, but let's say that it is our overall objective.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In this mad dash towards more liberal trade with the People's Republic of China, the Prime Minister threw out a clearly premature idea on his last trip to China, the idea of a free-trade agreement, which got a cold reception from President Xi Jinping.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Was the Prime Minister's statement a prepared one? Had the ground been prepared with Chinese authorities?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What was the stumbling block for the Prime Minister's initiative?, \n\xa0\nMr. Steve Verheul: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chairman, as was mentioned, we have been engaged in exploring improving commercial relations with China for many, many years. We successfully negotiated a foreign investment protection agreement with them a number of years ago. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We explored in depth the possibility of a potential free trade agreement negotiation with China. A number of meetings were held in 2017. We went through a scoping exercise to determine what such an agreement could look like, what each side's interests would be, and we did a significant amount of analysis in that direction. As it turns out, we were not able to come to an agreement, to initiate free trade agreement negotiations.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Given current circumstances, obviously the timing is not right now, but we continue to have an interest in further exploring our capacity for further growth in the Chinese market", ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I do not doubt that for a minute, but I was actually wanting to know about our approach to the Chinese authorities when the Prime Minister made his statement, and why it did not work', " \n\xa0\nMr. Steve Verheul: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I think the main challenge we had in moving forward with the free trade agreement at that time?and this was, as you'll recall, back in 2017?was that we had different perspectives on what we were looking for in a free trade agreement. China was looking for an agreement that would favour the kinds of interests they had, primarily to expand their exports to Canada. We had interests in getting further information and some constraints on their use of state-owned enterprises, which are very difficult to track in terms of the competitive advantages they offer.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We saw very little interest on the Chinese side on issues like government procurement, which were of interest to us. China showed little interest in having any kind of meaningful discussions on issues like labour and environment, which were also priorities for us as they are in any free trade agreement. We were not able to converge on the kind of negotiation and the kind of agreement we would be looking to achieve", " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In a previous life, I represented the constituency of Verch?res, with two major steel mills. At the time, our concern was mostly about lower quality steel from China being dumped on North American markets. With the new CUSMA, our concern is now about lower quality aluminum from China being dumped in North America.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That is our concern at the moment. How do you see it?, \n\xa0\nMr. Steve Verheul: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yes, it's quite true that we and many other countries around the world have had concerns about excess production of both steel and aluminum coming out of China and the resulting distortions in the world market.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 You will recall that the U.S. initiated the so-called section 232 measures on a national security basis against imports of steel and aluminum from around the world. We similarly took actions. It wasn't that kind of provision, but we have a number of anti-dumping and countervailing duty actions against imports of both steel and aluminum coming from China. There are some 67 different actions that are in place. We have had extensive discussions with the U.S. and Mexico in the context of the agreement we reached about ensuring that the North American market not become distorted by unfair imports of products that have been at artificially low prices from, in particular, China, but some other countries as well", " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's it? How time flies when you are having fun", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Harris', " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you to the witnesses for your presentations. I have a question regarding the canola situation. You outlined some of the steps that were taken and the timelines that are involved. Are you confident that the pace of these developments is in keeping with the normal process of trying to resolve questions of this nature? It seems to me that.... \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Are we going through the motions here or is there a genuine effort to resolve this?, \n\xa0\nMr. Fred Gorrell: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for the question. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0No, we're not satisfied with the pace. To make it clear, when the suspensions of our two largest trading companies came into effect in March, we asked for face-to-face meetings right away. For a period over the summer, we had been asking for face-to-face meetings to have the technical dialogue and exchange so that we could get the science-based evidence base to refute it. After we had WTO consultations?and I'll defer to my colleagues if you have questions on that?in October they did agree to have a face-to-face meeting, and we did have one with a rather large sizeable group in Beijing in December. We've had progress. They have been, I would say, positive but difficult conversations. We agreed to meet in February or March of this year to further the discussions. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Under normal circumstances we would have preferred a much more proactive approach from the Chinese, but they have been engaging and we do feel there is room for conversations with a scientific, evidence-based approach so that we can understand whether their position can be considered legitimate?or not", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It seems to me there's some evidence that this action, even based on the objective pace of the discussion, goes beyond the actual concern for the product itself", " \n\xa0\nMr. Fred Gorrell: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Deputy Morgan said it very well that the relationship between Canada and China is very complex. There may be other factors involved when decisions are made, but we're very much sticking in our swim lane relative to the technical aspects and the merits of it. I would leave that for others to decide", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It will soon be year since these measures were taken. At what point would you want to go forward with the WTO next step in seeking a resolution?, \n\xa0\nMr. Steve Verheul: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It is an ongoing analysis that we do as to when is the right time to take that further step. Part of the issue is that there are some ongoing technical discussions happening, and if we feel there is some forward movement in those discussions, then that could be a quicker way to resolve the problem than going through a lengthy WTO dispute settlement panel process. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0At some point, we will have to make the judgment as to whether those technical discussions are productive enough that we continue down that track, or whether we feel that it is now time to move on to a WTO panel request. It's an ongoing assessment and we'll continue to assess that as time goes on, but we also want to make sure that through these technical discussions we're collecting all of the evidence we need to put forward a very strong case at the WTO", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 On another matter, Professor Wendy Dobson, a former senior public servant in Canada, from the Rotman School of Management has suggested that some of our relationship with China could be increased or improved in terms of business interaction by developing multilateral rules of conduct in telecommunications, and also internationally accepted boundaries for cyberwarfare. I know you're not into the cyberwarfare business, but it is part of the relationship between technology and exchange, and of course we do have concerns about the issue of Chinese companies doing business in these fields. Certainly Huawei is the number one consideration on this list.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is any consideration being given to working on this issue, from your perspective or from Canada's perspective, to try to improve that situation?, \n\xa0\nMr. Steve Verheul: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There are a number of aspects to that issue. There are negotiations ongoing at the WTO now that involve electronic commerce. We are trying to advance those negotiations and so far we are making some progress on that front. If you're getting into some of the other issues that have more to do with security of information and issues that aren't related to trade, those are outside of our field, of course, and would have to be pursued elsewhere. I don't know if anybody else on the panel has further information on anything outside of the trade sphere", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would just add that we are mindful of the issues at stake and of the risks and we are constantly assessing how Canada can mitigate the risks that are inherent to those sectors', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You have 25 seconds', " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'll pass", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Mr. Harris.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Kusie', " \n\xa0\nMrs. Stephanie Kusie (Calgary Midnapore, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much to all of our guests for being here today. Of course, in the chamber right now we are debating the ratification of the new NAFTA. I'm interested in having your perspective on the U.S.-China relationship and whether it harmed or hampered the United States as it negotiated the new NAFTA with Canada and Mexico. Could we have your thoughts on that, please? Did the trade relationship between China and the U.S. help or harm the U.S. as it came to Canada and Mexico to negotiate this new NAFTA?, \n\xa0\nMr. Steve Verheul: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I don't think we could say that it harmed U.S. efforts to negotiate the new NAFTA other than through the fact that they were occupied with a number of different negotiations taking place at the same time. In terms of their level of attention and focus on different negotiations, there may have been some issues regarding working capacity. Beyond that, I don't think so, but I would point out that in certain chapters that we negotiated with the U.S. and Mexico?and I'll mention state-owned enterprises as one of those?much of the discussion within the negotiations of that chapter related to how we could best set an example for the world on how we have discipline on state-owned enterprises, which could perhaps be taken as a precedent for other free trade agreements. I think the U.S. was thinking of countries like China when we were negotiating some of those elements", " \n\xa0\nMrs. Stephanie Kusie: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You've spoken about the value of trade between China and Canada in tangible commodities. That's really what we've focused on here today, things like canola and pork, as well as services. Can you quantify the value of the new intangible commodities like IP, R and D, data, and others? How are we beginning to regulate and protect those valuable assets with respect to China?, \n\xa0\nMr. Duane McMullen (Director General, Trade Commissioner Service - Operations, Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Outside of the tangible trade between Canada and China, as the honourable member has observed, there is considerable intangible trade. For example, in the education sector there are over 140,000 Chinese students studying in Canada in communities all across our country. Not only are those students bringing economic benefits to Canada, but they're also learning about Canada and how our democracy and society operate. There is intangible trade and tourism by Chinese tourists. We have a science and technology collaboration agreement with China that supports science and technology collaboration in areas we think meet the interests of both Canada and China", ' \n\xa0\nMrs. Stephanie Kusie: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Perhaps you could expand upon it. How are we protecting ourselves in the new digital economy, please?, \n\xa0\nMr. Duane McMullen: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, as the previous question indicated, work is under way in the WTO multilaterally with all countries to figure out the ways to operate in this new environment and, specifically with Canada, we have a number of mechanisms.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 In particular, with Canadian companies looking to do business in China, we give them extensive advice, not only about the benefits of that business in China should it work, but also about some of the risks they need to be taking into account?for example, with respect to their intellectual property and other competitive aspects?and ways they can deal with those risks to protect their business, to be successful in China and not have that trade work out badly for them', " \n\xa0\nMrs. Stephanie Kusie: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Rivest, do you think that export decreases are retaliation for Kovrig and Spavor?, \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We've talked about canola and pork, and there has been talk about other sectors that have weakened a little bit. There is no clear link between those downtrends and the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, Mr. Chairman. There have been other sectors, as Mr. Verheul has mentioned, where exports have gone up. Not all sectors have experienced a downturn; there are only a few of them", ' \n\xa0\nMrs. Stephanie Kusie: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Then how do you account for these decreases?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Chair: Thank you, Ms. Kusie.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mrs. Stephanie Kusie: Thank you, Mr. Chair', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Oliphant', " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for this and your work.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I want to ask about the concept of trade diversification, both trade diversification toward the People's Republic of China, and trade diversification away from the People's Republic of China, and whether or not there is a move in the government?this is not part of the work I do?on how we help Canadian industries buffer various geopolitical issues that are going on.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It would seem to me that we've looked towards China for increased trade and investment because of certain factors in the world, and that we've looked at other parts of the world because of the complicated relationship with China right now. Is there a shift in government direction? Is there a move? This relates obviously to the United States. It relates to Canada-Europe and it relates to TPP and to how that is shaping your work and what it is you may be looking for this committee to offer advice on", " \n\xa0\nMr. Duane McMullen: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, in terms of trade diversification, the government has no policy of trade diversification away from China. We would like to grow our trade with China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 As we've heard from many of the questions, there members have concerns about how we increase our canola trade, how we increase our trade in forest products and how we increase our trade in all ranges of commodities and products and services. Our policy is to try to increase that trade. By so doing, our trade will be diversified.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As for individual companies, when we talk to them from a trade commissioner service perspective and we look at their global strategy, we encourage diversification as a general principle for them, because the data is very clear that companies that are more diversified in their trade are more successful. They pay better wages. They grow faster. They are less like to fail in a downturn.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 A company with very diversified sets of markets does much better. One goal of our policy and our efforts is to help companies reap those benefits of diversification by helping them to do that in whichever market they are interested", " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Last year, I met with the president of the B.C. cherry growers, in looking at the growing market for B.C. cherries in Asia and the comparative advantage we have because of the different growing season we have compared to other markets. They did say they had a concern about whether or not they were having all their cherries in one basket and whether they should be looking around.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Is this something your department does? Does it help a specific industry like that look at advantages? Also, are you exercising any cautionary advice for them with respect to China?, \n\xa0\nMr. Fred Gorrell: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you. It's a really good question. I would say that having cherries, eggs or whatever in one basket is never good. Our industry is aware of that, and we're aware of it too.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Just to complement or supplement my colleague's comments, we obviously want to grow our industry and market in China, but we are also looking at other markets in the region, with diversification in emerging markets. We could look at expanding still in Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, etc. We very much are doing that as well. Part of that is to manage the risk. If we do have all of the cherries in one basket, that is a problem. We do that at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, working with Global Affairs and all of our embassies abroad. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We do look at where we can maximize the opportunities for cherries and other products, but at the end of the day, it's the industry's choice of where they want to go. They will give us what they think are their priorities. We work with the other governments to do that, but at the end of the day, they will decide where to put their products. , \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the last four and a half years, have we expanded our trade footprint in China in terms of our investment, and in human resources or engagement? Is that something we have done? Is it bearing fruit, to use that theme?, \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, we have added resources on the trade commissioner service side. We've added some 25 resources in the past two years. We have three consulates on the mainland in addition to the embassy, and 10 trade offices were expanded over the years. It has certainly helped increase the number of Canadian businesses going to China and helped to open doors for them. Our trade, if you look the past 10 years, has gone up significantly with China for both large companies and SMEs. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Mr. Oliphant.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Williamson. , \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thanks to everyone for appearing this morning.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Just as a point of clarification, could you give us the number for the actual trade deficit? I know you provided the numbers for imports and exports, but what number do you have for our trade deficit with the PRC?, \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Looking at 2018 numbers, our exports were $27.6 billion. Our imports were $75.6 billion. The total trade is $103 billion", ' \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0So what is the trade deficit?, \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The deficit will be the difference between $75 billion and $27 billion', " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I get $48 billion. Is that...?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0A voice: Yes, it's $48 billion.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. John Williamson: I know it's simple math, but they were questions?, \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I apologize, Mr. Chairman. I don't have a calculator. , \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Long math: thank heavens we don't always need a machine for that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. McMullen, you were saying that it's the policy of the Government of Canada to increase our trade with China. Do I understand that correctly?, \n\xa0\nMr. Duane McMullen: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We have no policy to decrease our trade with China", ' \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Duane McMullen: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We are trying to grow our trade with every market', " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On the trade side, is it business as usual with China, even with everything that's happening right now with the detention and the WTO and...? You know the picture", " \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes. As we've talked about, there has been a chilling, with increased scrutiny at border points. It's not across the board; it's anecdotal. Some Canadian businesses are still doing well. Even within sectors the experiences are different. Business people are looking at what's happening in China and reassessing their risk appetite for China. , \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0But what about the Government of Canada?, \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We have resources. China is our second-largest and third-largest market. It will continue to grow and continue to be a huge and very important market for Canada. We cannot decouple from the growth of China. , \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes. You said it's the second and the third. What's the?, \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's the second country, and it's the third if you count the EU as one market", " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. Fair enough.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This is an odd question, but how does the department refer to Taiwan? Is it the Republic of China, is it Beijing, is it Taipei? What's the official line on Taiwan? Is it Free China?, \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Canada has a one China policy", ' \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0How do you refer to Taiwan?, \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Taiwan is an economy', ' \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Americans refer to it as their unsinkable battleship, and we refer to Taiwan as the economy', " \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Taiwan is an economy for us. It's a trade partner", " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0No, no. In a document, you don't refer to ?an economy?. What do you call Taiwan? I'm just curious to know how to refer to this piece of real estate", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We refer to Taiwan as Taiwan', " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Verheul, I'm just curious. As we talked about trade with nations around the world, you described a number of obstacles to what we would see as the path forward towards free trade. There was the use of state-owned enterprises. There was a list of challenges. Is it fair to say that if those disappeared, it would perhaps smooth the way to a trade agreement, but would also mean a very different China, and not the China we know today?, \n\xa0\nMr. Steve Verheul: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When we're saying there's potential for a free trade agreement with China, we're looking at the China of today. We've been involved in a number of free trade negotiations in recent years, some quite large ones, and it's always a matter of trying to match up how your partner's economy matches up to your economy. In the case of China, it's much more complex than it was with the European Union or with the Trans-Pacific Partnership members, or within North America, because China does have a different type of economy. They have their state-owned enterprises, and it's very hard to find examples of how they operate. It's difficult to figure out what kind of disciplines we could put on those and what kind of transparency obligations so we would know what's going on. They also provide a high volume of subsidies to certain industries. We would want to address those. , \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Let me just ask you..", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Sorry about that. You've had a little over five minutes now", ' \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I had five minutes', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I understand Ms. Zann and Mr. Fragiskatos are going to split their time', " \n\xa0\nMs. Lenore Zann: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, gentlemen. I come from Nova Scotia, representing Cumberland?Colchester, the northern region there. Nova Scotia remains Canada's leader in seafood exports, with over $2 billion in exports, as you probably know. That's 29% of Canada's total seafood experts. While the U.S. remains our largest market, China is our second-largest. In fact our seafood exports have increased by 36% in the last few years. However, the outbreak of the coronavirus with over 4,500 confirmed cases in China has now put the brakes on Nova Scotia's lobster sales and shipments. Just within the last few days there's been a sharp drop, which means that the price at the wharf has also dropped from around $10 a pound to around $8. Has there been any discussion yet about what if anything Canada can do, what the government can do, to deal with this problem if it continues? Is it happening to other Canadian exports to China?, \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, I was in Halifax the day before yesterday. I met with some of the companies there and with the Government of Nova Scotia. Nova Scotia has been very successful in developing a relationship with China, as you've said. We have heard that certain lobster shipments have been impacted. We have people at our embassy in Beijing, notably a representative from CFIA, looking into what is happening. It's difficult to reach officials responsible for customs during the Chinese New Year, but he's doing his best. We're not entirely sure if this is a new regulation yet, or whether it has to do with markets for seafood and live food products being closed, restaurants being closed, transportation and coal supply chains being disrupted and people just staying at home and not going to markets and, with the Chinese New Year celebration, those having been shut down and so on. Logically this has an impact on imports of certain food products from Canada, especially those like live lobster that are associated with the Chinese New Year", " \n\xa0\nMs. Lenore Zann: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I have one last question. Is it affecting other exports or is it just the lobsters?, \n\xa0\nMr. Fran?ois Rivest: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To our knowledge, no other exports have been affected yet. However, given the difficulties China is going through right now, it's not unlikely that there will be some disruptions", ' \n\xa0\nMs. Lenore Zann: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you', " \n\xa0\nMr. Fred Gorrell: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If I could just add a clarification, there are some other commodities that we are picking up?notional things on the meat side. Again, because restaurants are closed, the streets are as you've seen on TV, so the demand on some of the imports is softening. We are talking to the meat industry and it does look like there may be a slowdown as people assess the situation. , \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you to all of you for being here today.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If one accepts that the tensions between the U.S. and China are having a deep impact on the Canada-China relationship, as I think we should accept, then one could be forced to look in other directions. It's been suggested, for example, by former ambassador David Mulroney that, in his own words, ?Getting China right requires us to get Asia right.? From there the implication is that we ought to look at east Asia and southeast Asia, and expand relations with Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Australia, the countries of the ASEAN block, for example, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I know that we have CPTPP in place. We are moving in that direction, but I'll ask Mr. Verheul to what extent we are doing that. Can we do that even more as a way to sort of hedge and protect Canadian interests when we end up caught between two superpowers and their disputes? , \n\xa0\nMr. Steve Verheul: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, we are actively engaged in trying to ensure that we have good access and good relationships to those other markets. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Because of CPTPP we do have free trade relations with Japan. We have the same with Vietnam. We have a separate agreement with South Korea. We are exploring a potential agreement with the ASEAN countries, so we're deeply involved in trying to expand our footprint in Southeast Asia. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Mr. Fragiskatos.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much to the witnesses. I know we all appreciate your testimony here today, and thank you for coming. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Before we close, we're going to have a discussion, but would colleagues like to go in camera for a discussion on future business?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0No. We'll carry on publicly. Fine.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We'll suspend for a moment while we excuse our guests.\xa0\xa0(1130)\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\xa0(1130)\xa0\xa0\n\n, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The meeting will come back to order. Thank you very much. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There are a couple of issues for us to talk about. One is, of course, what the regular meeting time of the committee is to be, which has been a bit of a challenge to work out. The second thing is when the subcommittee wants to meet to consider the work plan. Those are the two questions I have in mind for what I hope will be a brief discussion. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I've been asked to reiterate that Tuesday, from 10 until noon, we'll have the briefing with consular affairs and justice, and then on Wednesday of next week from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. is the briefing with Ambassador Barton.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is there anything else in terms of...?, \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Chair, is that still 5:30 until 7:30?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As colleagues will recall, the slots that were available for special committees were on Mondays, 11:00 until 1:00 or 5:30 to 7:30; Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, 5:30 to 7:30; and Friday mornings, 8:45 to 10:45", " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm just going to suggest that once these initial briefings are done and the ambassador has spoken, there should be a good subcommittee meeting to then assess and review witnesses and all that. I just don't think we can do it before then.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The other issue is that we have a preference on this side?it's a preference, not a demand?to meet once a week for three hours as opposed to twice a week for two hours each, with the option of having occasional meetings added to that. We would like our default to be one meeting, three hours a week, because of committee responsibilities. Almost all of our members have a second committee that they are on, so we are trying to balance that. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We feel we need to keep it within the times allotted by the House for special committees. We think that, on occasion, we could do an extra evening meeting, but our preference is to meet on Monday and our preference is to have a three-hour meeting", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Members will recall, of course, that if we are outside the times I indicated a moment ago, we might have a problem with its being televised. Of course, we also talked about the fact that we can always be webcast.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Warkentin', " \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I understand the joy of being a Chair and trying to figure out what works for everybody.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I think we probably have to stick to the two-hour increments, for a couple of reasons. One is the technical aspects of scheduling, but also, two-hour increments are what other committees have, so if we start overlapping into other committees, it would make it that much more difficult for our members to schedule and to be able to attend.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Our preference is probably for two two-hour meetings, if there is a way. We're not adamantly opposed to the one three-hour meeting, but I think it's that much more difficult to plan", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's one thing that members would want to discuss at the subcommittee next week. Either way, I need to know when that should happen, when we have that meeting", " \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Let's plan. I'm available starting Monday, but if we'd like to have an initial subcommittee meeting on Monday just to simply nail that down, then we'll have another subcommittee meeting to talk about the work plan", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What time on Monday do you have in mind?, \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Monday morning or afternoon work fine for me', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Bergeron, the afternoon does not suit you? Okay. You have the floor', ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I just want to say that I agree with the first part of what Mr.\xa0Oliphant said and I disagree with the second part. I agree that it is perhaps appropriate to first hold the committee meeting with the second series of briefings, to have the meeting with the ambassador, and then to have the subcommittee meeting. As I see it, that could perhaps happen on Thursday morning or Thursday afternoon. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I repeat my preference for two meetings of two hours rather than one meeting of three hours. I also remind you that Mondays are much more difficult for me', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We could discuss that, of course, at the subcommittee. I guess the question is that Mr. Bergeron has suggested Thursday morning or afternoon for the subcommittee, as opposed to perhaps Monday or Tuesday.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Harris', " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I prefer the two meetings instead of one. I'm looking at Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and the committee meetings?as was mentioned, some people are on two committees, including me?on both Tuesday and Thursday. The exact slots, I don't know.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It seems to be that, with all consideration to Mr. Bergeron's position, Monday, for me at least, is wide open. I'm willing to come here and to be here for that, whatever time of day it is. I can do it in the afternoon or whenever else we can potentially accommodate Mr. Bergeron's situation. I'd be happy to do that. That's really all I have to add to this, but I agree with waiting until after Mr. Barton speaks to have a subcommittee meeting", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm hearing Thursday morning, at least from one member. Is Thursday morning a good time for the subcommittee to meet and try to work out an ongoing time or times for regular meetings?, \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That would be fine. What I would ask also is that there be a meeting of the whips to look at the convention that we have around special meetings and special committee times. Our whips have worked that out over many years and we think it needs the respect of members.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We work here Monday to Friday. That is our reality. We would like to respect the fact that other committees have times that are required. We have members in all the time slots of all the other committees, so we would like that respected. We think that probably is a whips' discussion to make sure that we are in agreement on that and then also have our subcommittee meeting", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's a request for the whips to deal with", " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's a request", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I also want to ask Mr.\xa0Bergeron, given that it involves him.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could you tell me what time on Thursday morning would suit you for the meeting? As for the length, would you prefer one hour or two hours?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Bergeron, you have the floor', ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The time does not matter at all. I will be there when and where you would like us to meet. I am fine if the meeting has to go for two hours.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would just like to react to what Mr.\xa0Oliphant has just said. Unless I am mistaken, I do not think we need to refer this to the whip. Time slots for special committees have already been reserved and they do not conflict with the time slots for the standing committees. Like most of my colleagues, I also sit on another standing committee. But I do not believe that there is the slightest possibility of conflict between the time slots for standing committees and those scheduled for special committees. We just have to reserve two time slots for the special committees. Normally, everything should work perfectly', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mr. Fragiskatos', " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I was just going to say, on the point about consulting the whips, that I think it makes sense, because this is a special committee, and they have the institutional knowledge. I certainly know that on our side, the official who we worked with from the whip's office has been here since the 1990s. There's plenty of experience on all sides for us to tap into that institutional knowledge to figure out how we can plan these meetings from a logistical perspective. We would be very wise to go back and consult them. I think that's a very reasonable suggestion", " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chairman, I might not have been clear. My comment about consulting the whips had to do with whether we were encroaching upon any other committee's time. That's all. , \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, and that's how I took it", " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If we're staying within the times that have been agreed to over the years by parties for special committees, I have no trouble, but if somehow someone is suggesting that we should not be meeting on days that are allotted for that, then that's my concern", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have an immigration committee at 8:45 next Thursday. Could we meet in subcommittee from 11 until 12? \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm getting some nods and thumbs up. Mr. Harris is hoping to be able to join us for that time. , \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm hoping to be able to come", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Very good.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to remind members to send your preliminary prioritized list of witnesses for the first wave, as some have said, to the clerk before 5 p.m. tomorrow. I look forward to the subcommittee meeting at 11 a.m. on Thursday and, of course, to the other meetings I already mentioned.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0With that, thank you very much. This meeting is adjourned.]']
["[\n\xa0\nThe Chair (Hon. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.)): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I call the meeting of the Special Committee on Canada-China Relations to order.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Good morning.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Our meeting this morning will consist of two parts.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The first hour, of course, will be on consular affairs, and the second hour will be on Canada's extradition process.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As colleagues know, tomorrow evening from 5:30 to 7:30 we'll meet and have Ambassador Barton.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On Thursday, the subcommittee will meet from 11 a.m. until noon.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Our first witnesses this morning, from the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development, are Heather Jeffrey, assistant deputy minister, consular, security and emergency management; and Mr. Brian Szwarc, director general, consular operations.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Good morning. I think you have a 10-minute presentation. Please go ahead", " \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey (Assistant Deputy Minister, Consular, Security and Emergency Management, Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Members of the Special Committee on Canada-China Relations, I'm very pleased to appear before the committee today to provide a briefing on consular services, with a particular focus on the People's Republic of China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My name is Heather Jeffrey. I'm the assistant deputy minister of consular, security and emergency management at Global Affairs Canada.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This is my colleague, Brian Szwarc, the director general for consular operations.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I will begin my presentation this morning by giving you an overview of the consular services provided to Canadians. I will then summarize the consular relationship with China, as well as our cases and the consular trends in that country. I will conclude by telling you about some of our most high profile cases in China.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Minister of Foreign Affairs is responsible for the provision of consular services to Canadians abroad. These services are delivered by Global Affairs Canada and are guided by the Canadian Consular Services Charter.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Canadian representatives provide consular services 24/7 through more than 260\xa0points of service across 150\xa0countries and through the Emergency Watch and Response Centre, in Ottawa.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In order to provide relevant information to Canadians during their travels abroad, Global Affairs Canada makes use of two tools. The department's travel advice and advisories provide information on safe travel to more than 200 destinations, and the registration of Canadians abroad service enables government officials to contact Canadians in emergency situations. The Canadian Consular Services Charter details the services that Canadian government officials can provide to Canadians abroad.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0These services include, for example, helping in a medical emergency by providing a list of local doctors and hospital services, providing victims of crime with advice and contact information for local police and medical services, assisting in cases of missing persons or the abduction of a child to another country, and the replacement of passports. In cases of arrest or detention, authorities are obligated by the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations to advise foreign nationals of their right of access to a consular representative. Once Canada is notified of the detention of a Canadian citizen, the first priority of consular officials is to seek immediate access to that person to determine their safety and well-being.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In such cases, consular officials would advocate for equal treatment in accordance with local laws, liaise with family and legal representatives, and provide detainees with information on the local judicial and prison systems. Our officials offer consular support to all Canadian citizens, regardless of whether they carry another citizenship. However, many foreign states, such as China, do not recognize dual citizenship and might refuse to allow consular access to individuals they consider to be citizens only of their own country. This is a situation that consular officials deal with regularly in the Chinese context.\xa0\xa0(1005)\xa0\xa0\n\n[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In total, about 175,000\xa0new cases have been opened throughout our consular network in 2019. The vast majority of cases are of a routine or administrative nature, such as passport services or proof of citizenship applications, and they are generally addressed quickly by our missions abroad.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0However, some 6,700\xa0cases are more complex. In general, these are cases where Canadians need help dealing with a difficult situation abroad, such as a death, an arrest or a detention, a crime, a medical problem or issues with child care. The United States, Mexico and China are the countries with the largest number of those complex consular cases. [English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It is important to note that protecting the personal information of our consular clients is paramount. Consular officials are obliged to work within the parameters set by the Privacy Act. For this reason, the government is often very limited in what details it can provide publicly regarding specific consular cases.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0With this overview of consular services offered by the Government of Canada, I will now provide some details specific to our consular services in China. Let me begin by giving a brief update on Canada's response to the novel coronavirus. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The current outbreak is of deep concern to Canadians in China, as well as in Canada. Actions are being taken to assist the impacted Canadians in Wuhan. As Deputy Minister Morgan informed you last week, Canada has secured a charter flight to bring Canadians from Wuhan, China to Canada, and we are finalizing arrangements with Chinese authorities to allow this flight to depart as soon as possible. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Global Affairs Canada is working closely with the Public Health Agency of Canada to provide relevant and timely travel and health information to Canadians in relation to the outbreak. Our travel advice was updated on January 24 to advise Canadians to avoid all travel to the province of Hubei due to the imposition of heavy travel restrictions in order to limit the spread of the virus. On January 29, we further updated the advisory to recommend against non-essential travel to China as a whole due to the outbreak.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Overall, in 2019 alone, consular officials opened 375 new cases in greater China. These include cases of arrest and detention, medical assistance, assault, well-being and whereabouts. There are currently 123 Canadians in custody in greater China. This figure is inclusive of Canadians in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. I want to stress that the number of Canadians in custody in China has remained stable over the last year.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The provision of consular services to Canadians in China is governed by a bilateral agreement signed by Canada and China more than 20 years ago. This agreement, which is available publicly, details the consular obligations and entitlements of our two countries in order to facilitate the protection of the rights and interests of our citizens.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I will now summarize some of the most high profile cases concerning China, which I think are of special interest to the committee.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Given the public nature of this meeting, I am limited by the provisions of the Privacy Act when it comes to personal information I can share.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Government of Canada is extremely concerned by the cases of Canadians arbitrarily detained or facing the death penalty in China. Canadian representatives at all levels have raised those concerns with their Chinese counterparts, and they will continue to do so. [English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Canada opposes the use of the death penalty in all cases everywhere. Aligned with this principle, the Government of Canada seeks clemency for all Canadians facing the death penalty. Canada has raised with China our firm position on the death penalty, and we have called on China to grant clemency to Canadians facing this sentence.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, the Government of Canada has been unwavering in its position and in calling for their immediate release and return to Canada. As you will no doubt be aware, Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor were detained by Chinese authorities on December 10, 2018, accused of posing a threat to China's national security. They were formally arrested on May 6, 2019.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Officials at the Embassy of Canada to China have had regular consular access to Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor since their detention in December 2018, conducting consular visits on an approximately monthly basis. The latest consular visit to Mr. Spavor took place on January 13, and to Mr. Kovrig on January 14, led by Ambassador Barton. The Government of Canada has been very clear that these two Canadians have been unacceptably and arbitrarily detained. We will continue to call for their immediate release.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Robert Schellenberg was detained by Chinese authorities in 2014 and charged with drug smuggling. He was initially sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment, but at a December 2018 appeal hearing, a Chinese court ordered a retrial. The next month a judge overturned the initial verdict and issued a death sentence. Mr. Schellenberg appealed the death sentence, and a hearing took place in May 2019. The verdict is pending.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Canada has strongly condemned the sentence of death imposed on Mr. Schellenberg at his retrial, and we expressed our extreme concern that China chose to arbitrarily apply the death penalty in his case. We have called on China to grant clemency to Mr. Schellenberg.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The particular cases that I've highlighted today represent only a few cases of the Canadian citizens in custody in China. While privacy considerations limit me from providing any details on specific cases, I want to stress that Canadian officials, both here and in China, are actively engaged on all of these cases and will continue to raise concerns with Chinese authorities.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for the opportunity to present this consular overview to the committee. We look forward to your questions", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Now we'll begin with the first round of questioning. We have Mr. Genuis", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood Park?Fort Saskatchewan, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you to the witnesses. It's a pleasure to be here at this important committee.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Maybe I'll start with a case that's been in the news recently, the case of a woman who's a permanent resident and is in Wuhan. I wonder if you could speak to the approach you take with permanent residents around the provision of consular services, and maybe walk out a little bit the decision not to include in the evacuation those who are permanent residents of Canada", " \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The situation in Wuhan was first raised just over a week ago, with the imposition of quite severe quarantine restrictions on a large province. The Chinese government imposed these measures in an effort to stop the spread of the coronavirus. With the imposition of those measures, Canadians and permanent residents in the province found themselves unable to depart. Commercial means of transportation were blocked.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Since that time, we have been working 24-7 to reach out to those Canadians and to find ways to assist them. Minister Champagne spoke yesterday about the measures being taken in terms of the evacuation flight. In cases of a humanitarian nature, such as those we see in Wuhan, our policy is to provide full services to all Canadians, permanent residents and their families, to the extent that we are able. However, the policy of the Government of China is that our consular access and services be restricted, in practice, to Canadian citizens and, in many cases, to Canadian citizens who entered China on a Canadian passport or travel document.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We've been working with the Chinese government to find a way to facilitate the exit of those Canadians on our evacuation flights. We've obtained the agreement of the Chinese government to allow permanent residents to accompany Canadian citizen children who need to evacuate that zone?which is some progress. We are continuing to advocate for others, but in the final analysis, it will be the decision of the Government of China whether they allow that. On our side, for the purposes of the Government of Canada, we are doing our best to offer those services to Canadians", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay, just to be very clear, there's a story in The Toronto Sun about a particular case, a woman named Debbie Lu. What you're saying is that the Canadian government is prepared to support her evacuation and that of other people in that situation?that is, permanent residents without children?if the Chinese government allows it", " \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We're engaged in discussions with the Government of China about what restrictions they're placing on the evacuation operations. I'm not in a position to comment about where those discussions will end, but we are making some progress, and we will continue to work on this", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay, thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In a different vein, in the context of ?the two Michaels,? as they're often called, there has been a lot of political commentary by prominent people connected with the governing party making suggestions. For instance, a prisoner exchange was what one former minister had suggested as a way to resolve this. Could you comment on the appropriateness of that kind of suggestion?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0From the perspective of the Privacy Act, in order to protect the individual in question, it would not be advisable for us to comment on the strategies for any particular case.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What I will say is that we are working very intensively for the safe return of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, and for the clemency of Mr. Schellenberg. We do that by assessing the variety of approaches we can take, the different channels. We consult.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In this case, where these cases are so evidently intertwined with broader bilateral considerations, we work across government and with other partners to pursue every possible avenue. That includes private and public advocacy. It includes bilateral engagement directly. It can also include joint approaches with other countries", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Right. Can I just dig into that point, though? Take it away from the particulars, then, and make it a hypothetical prisoner exchange of somebody lawfully detained in Canada for somebody arbitrarily detained in another country. Would you ever recommend that as a good approach for trying to resolve a consular case?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In terms of the consular services we can provide to people who are arbitrarily detained?and we call this case an arbitrary detention because of the timing of it, because of the decision to order Mr. Schellenberg's retrial, because of the public comments that were made by China's prosecutor general in terms of the circumstances of the detention?we are using every avenue available through our consular services to advocate for their well-being, to provide consular services directly through our visits, and also to develop the consular plans and strategies that inform the whole-of-government approach", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I completely agree with you in the characterization of these people as being arbitrarily detained.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is it fair to say that comments that suggest Canada should be releasing a person who was legally arrested by independent law enforcement agencies...? Is it fair to say that comments by politically well-connected people along those lines are very unhelpful to Canada in trying to actually make the case that these are arbitrary detentions in China?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm not going to speak to the views of others, Mr. Chair", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's fair enough", " \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I can only speak to the consular approach that we are taking on the ground, and I can assure you that we're working very intensively through channels at all levels of government", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could I just ask about the Celil case? Can you give us an update at all on the Celil case and what action the Government of Canada is taking around that case?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Speak very briefly', " \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Government of Canada is deeply concerned by the credible reports of detention and family separation of Uighurs in China, which run counter to China's human rights obligations. We've urged the Chinese authorities to release those who are detained.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the case of Mr. Celil, we have not been granted consular access to him, but we continue to advocate and to call on Chinese authorities to do so", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Genuis.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We will go to Mr. Oliphant', " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant (Don Valley West, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I start by offering huge thanks from members of the Liberal caucus for your work. I think 2020 has been one of the most taxing years that I have seen with respect to consular services, with the downing of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752, which was hugely taxing for your small department, to be immediately followed by the coronavirus crisis. So, thank you for what you do, and for coming here. I thought you might have good excuses not to be here today.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You raised the issue that we have thousands of consular cases every year. We have hundreds of difficult ones and a hundred or so very complex cases. That work is ongoing. In the midst of this, the coronavirus has required that you be nimble. I'm just wondering how you started with the coronavirus plans. There has been criticism that we didn't have a plan from the government side, and I have seen some of those plans. What kind of planning process do you start with when you're facing early signs of a health issue like a pandemic-like coronavirus?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, we began with reporting through our emergency watch and response centre, which is actually an emergency management tool that conducts a bit of a watch on what's happening globally around the world. We have situation reporting to inform people of developing situations.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the case of the coronavirus, we began in January to track the spread of that virus. On January 26, we stood up an emergency response team when we saw the measures being taken by the Government of China to control the spread of that virus and the challenges that it was putting in place for local residents in Hubei province in particular.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would say that, at the time, the full extent of the Canadian presence in Hubei province was not immediately evident. We don't have a consulate in that province. At the time there was only a very small number of Canadians who were actually registered through the registry of Canadians abroad as being resident in Hubei.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would say, generally, that when Canadians feel in a more secure or safe place they tend not to think about registering with the government when they travel. They do so, I think, in what they perceive as more dangerous or hostile areas. In this case, I think we had only about 38 Canadians registered. Now we know that there are many more?we're up to 565 Canadians registered in Hubei province. About eight or nine days ago we had no requests for consular assistance. Those requests have obviously escalated.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Currently, all the requests we have in Hubei are from Canadians seeking assistance to depart. We have no cases of Canadians who are ill with the virus who are looking for our help to leave the province. We've been working with the Government of China to obtain those permissions.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Obviously, a response and evacuation out of a quarantine zone in a country such as China poses some unique challenges. Every emergency response is different, and this one indeed has a lot of complexity to it. We immediately put in place a process to put together the evacuation flight and seek the necessary permissions. We required visas from the Chinese government, and we required overflight clearances from a number of countries, some of which have closed their airspace in recent days. All of those challenges have been met and overcome, and we are now not that far away from removing the first tranche of Canadians from that situation. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0But it does require a very detailed response. We had to send a ground team into Wuhan, so we now have a consular team on the ground in Wuhan city. They are preparing the logistics for the departure. We've been working with local authorities, completing the manifests of passengers and also compiling all the details that are required for ground movements in an area under such severe quarantine restrictions. People have to inform us of their routings, about how they're going to get to the airport?, \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Obviously we have a frayed relationship right now with China, and it has been difficult for over a year. In this instance, have you found this to be a normal exchange that you would expect with Chinese officials? Have they been co-operative or not co-operative? Are they seeking our assistance? Are we seeking their assistance? \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's an abnormal situation, but is this within the range of what you would expect for Canada-China co-operation?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In terms of the discussions we have had with the Chinese authorities in regard to the evacuation plans, these discussions have been constructive. We have been working. They have issued visas for our team. We are working through the details of some of the complex family situations that have been raised. We are continuing to have those dialogues, and they've been responsive to our requests to date", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Bergeron, go ahead', " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron (Montarville, BQ): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr.\xa0Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I thank our witnesses for joining us today, especially in this busy context.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to start out with a very simple question. Do members have an exclusive line to discuss consular cases with Global Affairs Canada?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the cases of members of Parliament, we do work directly in some cases. When families provide consent for members of Parliament to act on their behalf, we'll engage to the extent that families allow", " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay, but is there a direct line for members or is Global Affairs Canada in general called?, \n\xa0\nMr. Brian Szwarc (Director General, Consular Operations, Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 If I may answer that, please, there is a process by which members can direct their inquiries to the office of the minister. They can raise those issues on behalf of their constituents. We have a very well-working process for those requests to be directed to?, \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0So the minister's cabinet is involved?, \n\xa0\nMr. Brian Szwarc: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, exactly", " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have a second question. In light of the consular cases you have brought to our attention, would you say that China has violated the Canada-China Consular Agreement?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The agreement that we have bilaterally between Canada and China, as I mentioned, is 20 years old. It was put in place to establish a minimum threshold for access in particular cases of dual nationality. Prior to that, there had been extreme challenges. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It lays out, I would say, what we consider to be the minimum standards, and we're always advocating to go beyond them", ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You are telling us that you were refused consular access to a Canadian citizen. Is that not a violation of the agreement between the two countries?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Under the agreement, China has agreed to provide us with access only to those Canadian citizens who entered China on a Canadian travel document. If you are a dual national of China and entered on a Chinese document, under the agreement, China has said that they will not provide us access', ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Was that provision on dual nationality part of the agreement between the two countries?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Our position as the Government of Canada is that all Canadian citizens have the right to consular access under the Vienna Convention, and we continue to advocate for that at every opportunity. There are many countries in the world that do not accept that position, but we continue to advocate despite that', ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay, but was that provision, more specifically, part of the agreement between the two countries?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The agreement was signed in part to respond to the fact that the Government of China was refusing to recognize consular access for any dual-national Canadians in China. It allowed us to make some progress in terms of accessing dual-national Canadian-Chinese citizens who entered China on Canadian travel documents.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We would obviously prefer, and we continue to advocate as a position of the Government of Canada, that we have access to all Canadians', " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Generally speaking, how many consular visits have Mr.\xa0Kovrig and Mr.\xa0Spavor received? How long were those visits on average? In what kind of climate or conditions would you say those visits took place? What have you noted in terms of the detention conditions of those two Canadians?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As I'm sure the committee can appreciate, behind every one of these consular cases are the personal situations of Canadians in distress. To protect their privacy, and to protect the privacy of their families, we're not going to comment on the specific details of their conditions or their cases.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We continue to visit them, and we have had monthly access to both Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor. Unfortunately, for reasons of the Privacy Act, and to protect the families and those individuals and the progression of their cases, I'm not going to comment on their personal situations", ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay, but would you say that you have adequate access?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I would say that we are continuing to advocate for greater consular access to Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor and for their access to their families and to additional supports. We advocate for their well-being with local authorities, and we are continuing to find every possible way to support them in what are very difficult circumstances', " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Here is a very simple question. If this committee's members potentially decided to travel to China for a visit, would you foresee any consular difficulties for them? Would that kind of a visit add value to this committee's conclusions regarding future relations between China and Canada?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, the advice that we offer to all Canadians is our travel advice for China. At the current time, our travel advice is at level three, which is to avoid all non-essential travel to China", ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That visit would happen later', " \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We'll be continually reassessing the situation, and I'm sure we would be happy to engage with the committee in terms of the travel advice in the moment that you're considering.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In terms of the work of the committee and its mandate, I will respectfully leave that up to the chair and the members, but we remain at your service to answer questions and to support your work", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Have you discussed the issue of visas? It may be useful for the committee members to know more about that. Does the witness think it would be difficult or not?, \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think this is a very interesting complementary question, Mr.\xa0Chair', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Do you want to address that just for a second? I'm sorry to interrupt", " \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I can't comment on a hypothetical question. We would have to?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Fair enough. Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Harris", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris (St. John's East, NDP): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you to the witnesses for coming.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I did have one question at the beginning. I asked you about it earlier. You're listed as the ADM of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development. We keep hearing about Global Affairs Canada. I'm assuming they're the same thing. One may be more of a brand. Could you explain the difference?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I believe that the continuing legal name of the department is Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development, but the working name that we use is Global Affairs Canada, so they're both correct", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you. I think knowing the difference might help some people on the committee and in the general public.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I also have some other questions, but I want to follow up briefly on Mr. Genuis's question about bringing permanent residents back to Canada. I didn't get a confirmation from you that Canada would be happy to bring permanent residents back to Canada as part of this evacuation, as long as there's consent from the Chinese government. Is that correct?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In terms of the provision of consular services brought under the Vienna Convention, that provision of consular services is focused on Canadian citizens in the first instance. However, in cases of natural disaster, humanitarian responses and evacuations such as what we see in Hubei, we try to preserve family unity and extend services to those Canadian citizens and permanent residents to whom we are able to. That has been the case, for example, in previous responses to hurricanes and in other emergency responses.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the case of the particular situation in Hubei province, the Chinese government has made it clear that its position is initially that foreign nationals who are travelling on their foreign national travel documents would be facilitated to exit, and we have managed to work with the Chinese government?, \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt. I understand that. Mr. Genuis was speaking about a person who wasn't accompanying a Canadian citizen child but was a permanent resident of Canada. My question is this: Would the Canadian government assist in the evacuation of such a person, assuming that the Chinese government approved?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We have been working with all Canadians and permanent residents on the ground. We've been exchanging with them to determine their needs. At the moment, it is a hypothetical question. We're working with the Chinese government to see what is possible and how we can assist everyone who is on the ground there seeking to depart.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We recognize fully that it's an extremely difficult situation to be confined and not to have an opportunity for departure", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I appreciate that, although I don't want to waste my whole time on this question. I thought it was a yes-or-no question. Obviously, it's not a yes-or-no question. There are people who want to come back who are permanent residents but are not being accompanied by children, and the answer is qualified. I understand that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Can I ask about the bilateral agreement with China, about the Vienna Convention? Is China in compliance with the Vienna Convention? Was the 1999 agreement to add additional safeguards, or was it to try to get China to agree to abide by the Vienna Convention?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 What I would say is that the Vienna Convention, obviously written many years before the prevalence of dual nationality, doesn't contemplate specifics in regard to many of the modern-day challenges that we face in terms of the provision of consular services. It's for this reason that we have been trying to work bilaterally with different countries to try to enforce the access that we need to serve Canadians abroad. The Vienna Convention provides a lot of different protections, both diplomatically and in terms of consular officials, but we are looking for more specific undertakings from governments in order to allow us to do our work", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0So your suggestion is that the bilateral agreement is inadequate for these circumstances', " \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm suggesting that we're continuing to advocate for greater consular access to Canadians than the Chinese government is providing us with", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think that does answer the question. Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We're advised that the current travel advisory for China indicates that Canadians should ?exercise a high degree of caution in China due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws?. This is from the notes provided to us as of January 24. Is that a new designation? How long has that been in effect?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The current travel advice, as I mentioned, is actually that Canadians should avoid non-essential travel to China because of the coronavirus and the measures taken to prevent its spread.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Last January, we did update the advice to highlight the risks of arbitrary detention, and there is a great deal of detailed information in the travel advice about the different areas against which we caution Canadians, and some of the things that they would need to consider. The decision whether or not to travel to a particular country is a decision of individual Canadians, and our efforts are to provide them with the information they need about what we have observed and some of the challenges that Canadians have experienced. Also, we provide information on local contacts so that they can take the best informed decision possible", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's always good advice to be careful, but my question is whether that is something new as a result of the developments with Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, or is that advice that you've always given? Is that always a concern in China, or is this a new concern that's being highlighted for a particular reason?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The level of the advice was at ?exercise a higher degree of caution? prior to that, and we have brought up the level of that particular risk to the top of the advisory to draw the attention of Canadians to it", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Do you have a list? In addition to the two who are top of mind, are there a number of Canadians who are, in the view of consular affairs of Canada, considered to be arbitrarily detained in China?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Arbitrary detentions take place in different countries across the world, but in relation to the Government of China, the two cases of arbitrary detention that we have highlighted are the two cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, and also the sentencing of Mr. Schellenberg to the death penalty', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Mr. Harris.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Go ahead, Mrs. Kusie', " \n\xa0\nMrs. Stephanie Kusie (Calgary Midnapore, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's great to see you both, my former colleagues. I was remarking to Brian that I was actually his assignment officer when he was in Mongolia, so I can't believe we've come full circle here.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Of course, coming from the position of a former diplomat, my strong core belief is that diplomats do only what their government asks them to do. My questioning is always to see where you receive your direction from, working for the government and working for your political masters. I'll start with asking where Kovrig and Spavor are currently detained in China", " \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm sorry but, as I explained earlier, due to the Privacy Act, I'm not going to comment on the particular circumstances of the cases", " \n\xa0\nMrs. Stephanie Kusie: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay, so we'll assume, for the sake of this, that they are detained in Beijing. You mentioned that there is the consular agreement between Canada and China beyond the provisions outlined in the Vienna Convention. Would we be able to table that document here within the committee?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Do you mean the consular agreement? It's available publicly on our website", " \n\xa0\nMrs. Stephanie Kusie: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Super.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Has there been a contiguous consul in Beijing since the time of their detention?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We have always had a mission in Beijing. We have had a charg? d'affaires, an ambassador, a head of consular section?, \n\xa0\nMrs. Stephanie Kusie: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Has there been one consul since their detention?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Do you mean in terms of the consular officer in particular?, \n\xa0\nMrs. Stephanie Kusie: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's correct, like one consul", ' \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We have a consular team', " \n\xa0\nMrs. Stephanie Kusie: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could we get the name of the consul since their detention?if there has been more than one, the names of those consuls?and have those brought to the committee? That would very much be appreciated.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Who was the head of mission at the time of their detention?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 At the time of their detention, it was our previous ambassador, Ambassador McCallum. , \n\xa0\nMrs. Stephanie Kusie: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. Whom did the head of mission report to in Ottawa regarding these two cases?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Heads of mission are appointed by the Prime Minister and?, \n\xa0\nMrs. Stephanie Kusie: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. Whom did they report to in Ottawa? Did they report to the geographic officer, or did they report to a more senior officer than the desk officer?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'd like to explain that the consular strategy we apply in cases is developed by the consular team in consultation with our colleagues. We develop those strategies and consult, then, across the government and? , \n\xa0\nMrs. Stephanie Kusie: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think it would be helpful if we could find out here in the committee whom the head of mission reported to in Ottawa at the time of the detention in these two cases and throughout these two cases. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Who was the deputy head of mission at the time of the detention of Kovrig and Spavor?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Our deputy head of mission is Mr. Jim Nickel", ' \n\xa0\nMrs. Stephanie Kusie: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Was he the deputy head of mission at the time of the detention?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes', " \n\xa0\nMrs. Stephanie Kusie: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. Excellent.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Which officers were assigned to Kovrig and Spavor during this time?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm happy to get.... I don't have all the details of the staffing of the embassy. We're happy to work with the clerk and the chair of the committee to provide that information", " \n\xa0\nMrs. Stephanie Kusie: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. That's great.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I understand the privacy information that you provided previously, but during my time in the operations centre from 2004-05, I recall my colleagues specifically working on the case of Omar Khadr in an attempt to provide that information, certainly with redaction as necessary.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0With that, I would ask if it would be possible for the committee to have all CAMANT notes tabled from the two cases, please. , \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Privacy Act governs what we are able to release publicly. We'll work with the clerk of the committee to respond to whatever requests are made", " \n\xa0\nMrs. Stephanie Kusie: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. I've asked for a lot here in terms of names and information, but certainly if we could receive this two weeks from today, Mr. Chair, whatever date that is, I would genuinely appreciate it.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Now, I'll move to the greater consular issue, which of course at this time is the coronavirus. I would like to know why our response lagged behind other nations so significantly", " \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I will say that we responded very quickly to the outbreak. We've been tracking it since it began. We have been tracking as well the needs of Canadians as they developed. As I mentioned earlier, we don't have a consular presence on the ground?, \n\xa0\nMrs. Stephanie Kusie: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Which consulate does Hubei province report to?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The witness was just talking about the consular presence on the ground in Wuhan, but I'd like to hear the answer and then go on.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You've just heard the question Mrs. Kusie asked. , \n\xa0\nMrs. Stephanie Kusie: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chair", " \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As I mentioned, we do not have a consular presence in Wuhan. The area of Wuhan is under the governance of our consulate in Shanghai and we're providing consular services through the consular section there.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As reports came in that Canadians might be having difficulty leaving the area, we tracked those. We engaged with those Canadians, but actually it was not until the beginning of last week or midway through the week that it became apparent there was a systemic problem with a very large number of Canadians who were going to need assistance. We immediately took action to engage options to charter a plane or work?, \n\xa0\nMrs. Stephanie Kusie: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Perfect. Thank you. If we could get the consular plan from Shanghai tabled for the committee, that would be excellent as well.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Finally, who is currently leading the standing rapid deployment team out of GAC, please?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The rapid deployment teams are under my management at Global Affairs Canada. They are trained and dispatched through the emergency watch and response centre", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you?, \n\xa0\nMrs. Stephanie Kusie: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If we could get the plan from the rapid deployment team tabled, that would be great.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Ms. Jeffrey.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm sorry. I was getting around to the five-minute round, and I was thinking six minutes, so forgive me for that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I do want to make sure of this. Perhaps the witnesses have appeared at committees before, but I want them to understand that when members have only a short time, sometimes they will be anxious to get in as many questions as they can. I've certainly experienced that myself on committee in the past.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The next five minutes are going to be shared between Ms. Zann and Ms. Yip, I believe.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Zann, please", " \n\xa0\nMs. Lenore Zann (Cumberland?Colchester, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think Ms. Yip is going to go first. , \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip (Scarborough?Agincourt, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for coming. I really have to commend the hard work that you and your team have done in response to the downing of flight 752 and the recent coronavirus.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Have Chinese authorities presented any evidence regarding the national security charges against Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm not going to comment on the details of the cases. Those cases are still under investigation by the Chinese authorities, according to what we've been told. , \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Well, I'm going to give this another try. When are Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor expected to be tried, and when they are tried, will they have access to effective legal representation?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The timeline for trial and sentencing is very flexible, and there are many opportunities generically in the Chinese system for extensions and adjustments. It wouldn't be appropriate for me to speculate on timing in any specific case", " \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Are they receiving any legal advice now from the consular officials?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Again, I'm sorry. These are all details of their personal situations.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 As I mentioned, I'm sure that the committee can appreciate that these are very difficult situations for Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor and their families. They have asked for privacy. Under the Privacy Act, we're obliged, as consular officials, to respect that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 With respect, unfortunately I can't answer your question. I'm sorry", " \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0With respect to Robert Schellenberg, have Canadian consular officials had access to him since the ruling that he be put on death penalty?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, we have been provided consular access to Mr. Schellenberg and we've visited", " \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0How many Canadians are on death row?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Due to the Privacy Act, I'm not going to comment on the cases of specific Canadians and their sentencing", ' \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Would you like your time now, Lenore?, \n\xa0\nMs. Lenore Zann: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Bergeron, do you have a point of order?, \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, Mr.\xa0Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I understand our officials' reservations regarding details on ongoing consular cases.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0However, this was a general question simply to find out how many Canadians are facing a death sentence. We just need a figure and not details. So it seems to me that the information can be shared with us", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Mr.\xa0Bergeron.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I understand that the witnesses want to make sure to respect the law. It is also clear that the committee members would like to get as much information and details as possible', " \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0While I can't speak to the details of the cases, there are two Canadians?Mr. Schellenberg and Mr. Fan Wei?whose charges on the death penalty are public and available", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Zann', " \n\xa0\nMs. Lenore Zann: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr.\xa0Chair.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for being here. Again, thank you so much for your hard work on behalf of Canadians. As has been said, we know you're under a lot of stress. The situation keeps changing, I'm sure, and you have to become pretty nimble to deal with it.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would like to know a little more about the situation on the ground with regard to the coronavirus and the Canadians who are still in China. I believe they are being quarantined right now, everybody who is there. Is that correct? Also, what are you telling the Canadians there to do to protect themselves for their health?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Government of China has taken different measures in different areas to respond to the spread of the coronavirus in an effort to impede its continued extension. Hubei province is the focus of attention because of the particular restrictions around travel in and out of that province. For example, it required special permissions for our consular team to enter Hubei province. It is closed to traffic. Canadians in Hubei province have been telling us in their conversations with us that they have been instructed to stay in their homes and to avoid gatherings.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Many of these types of measures to impede the spread of the virus?in terms of avoiding large groups and these types of things?actually would align with the advice that we take, which is given by the Public Health Agency of Canada as the expert body in Canada that advises us. We have been consulting with them. They've provided advice to us in terms of how to protect not only our staff but also Canadians on the ground. The measures are the same that they have spoken about here in Canada: frequent washing of hands, avoiding contact, self-isolation and these kinds of things. We've also provided advice on what to do to avoid exposing others if you have symptoms.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 They've also advised us on the types of protective kit that we should be using. For our flights, we have very detailed medical advice on how those flights will take place. We will have a DND medical team on board the aircraft to provide medical assistance to Canadians who might need it inflight.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In terms of the evacuation, I would just underline that the Government of China will be conducting medical checks. Given the nature and the reasoning behind the quarantine, they have informed us that no one who is symptomatic will be allowed to depart Hubei province. They will be conducting medical checks on entry to the airport, inside the airport. We will also be conducting, through DND medical personnel, checks before Canadians board the aircraft, to ensure everyone's safety and security", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you, Ms. Zann.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As I go to Mr. Albas, I hope you won't mind my suggesting that members of Parliament probably should wash their hands more than most, because I can't think of any other group that every weekend goes off to every part of the country, shakes lots of hands and comes back to Ottawa and shakes lots of hands.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Albas", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas (Central Okanagan?Similkameen?Nicola, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for the work you do. Obviously a lot of resources are given to your department and, like all of us, when you give someone resources, you expect people to use them wisely.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I would like to make a quick statement, especially for new members of Parliament, on embassies and consulates.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 When members of Parliament could no longer contact the embassies and consulates directly on behalf of their constituents for routine matters?this occurred right after the Liberals took office in 2015?I have to say, from my own experience as a constituency worker, that it complicated things. It also insulates those consulates from the general public, as does, I believe, the Privacy Act. I believe it gives too much insulation for the government.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I would like to see a little more transparency from your department when it comes to these things, because ultimately all our salaries are paid for by the public, and it shouldn't take a crisis for people to start getting basic information specifically. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm going to be focusing largely on those matters today, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There are no publicly available statistics on the number of Canadians in China and the number of consular cases, so could you start by saying how many Canadians are currently in mainland China and in Hong Kong? Also, how do those figures compare to previous years?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, I can respond to that in part. The Government of Canada does not track inside China the presence of Canadians. We don't track the travel of Canadians. This is an area where our figures?not just for China, but for the rest of the world?are not complete. We don't have a firm estimate about how many Canadians might be in China at any given point in time", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Again, from a public interest standpoint, this insulates the government, because we effectively don't know if the government is resourcing our consulates in the correct regions that face the biggest challenges. I would simply say that a little more transparency needs to happen there.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Let's go to things that you can talk about. How many Canadian consular cases are active in China right now?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In 2019, there were 375 new consular cases in China", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0How many were routine or administrative in nature? How many would be considered more complex?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If I look at the overall number of cases the way we track them, there were 26,500 cases in 2019 in China: 4,500 of those were citizenship requests; 20,000 were passport-related; and there were 375 of what we term ?consular cases?, which are more complex. Of those, 123 were cases of detention.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 These are figures for greater China, so that includes Hong Kong and Taiwan. The arrest and detention cases are primarily related to drug-related crimes and to fraud. We had 135 cases of deaths abroad; 48 requests for well-being and whereabouts, with people looking for their family members; 36 requests for medical assistance; and 12 family-related children's cases", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Obviously there is a fair bit of concern for Canadians who are detained abroad, particularly in China. Can you give us a total number? Again, I believe Mr. Bergeron asked a good question. I do think we should have a general number of how many Canadians are detained', ' \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Do you mean globally?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In China', ' \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Currently, we have 123 Canadians who are detained in greater China. That includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan', " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0How many have happened in the past year?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm sorry. I'll have to?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Would you mind maybe tabling it for the past few years, just so we can understand that better, just to see if there's an uptick? I think it's important to know. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0For those Canadians, how are they able to access needed consular services? You explained it a little: that if anyone asks, then you have a duty to it.... That's not legislated, is it?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You have 35 seconds", " \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Consular assistance in Canada is granted under the royal prerogative, and our consular policy is to offer consular service to all Canadians under the consular charter. We are typically notified by host governments of detention cases. If we are notified of them by other sources, we will proactively contact detention centres and local authorities and reach out.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Not in all cases in all jurisdictions are local authorities as assiduous in informing us as we would like, so we use all possible means. People don't have to reach out to us. We're actively looking for them in most cases", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Dubourg, go ahead', " \n\xa0\nMr. Emmanuel Dubourg (Bourassa, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It is now my turn to greet you and to thank you for joining us.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would like to come back to the cases of Mr.\xa0Kovrig and Mr.\xa0Spavor. I hope that you will be able to answer this question.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You said that consular representatives are allowed to visit those two prisoners once a month. I would like to know something if the law allows you to answer. Since their arrest, have those men's families been able to get in touch with them, either by telephone or by visiting?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm sorry, Mr. Chair, but, with respect, due to the Privacy Act and the wishes of the families, I'm not going to comment on the particular circumstances of their cases and their interactions. I'm sorry", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Emmanuel Dubourg: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay, thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have other questions. You just told my colleague that 123\xa0Canadians are currently under arrest, be it in China or in Hong Kong. We know that, last year, highly virulent protests took place in Hong Kong, more specifically. Were any Canadians arrested during those protests? If so, how many?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We did have reports of a number of Canadians who were detained related to those demonstrations. However, to my knowledge, all have now been released, and we have no Canadians currently detained', " \n\xa0\nMr. Emmanuel Dubourg: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. I know that I don't have much time left.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When the risk level in a country is increased, as is currently the case in China, are you consulted? What is the procedure?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In deciding to raise the level of travel advice, we take input from a wide variety of sources. We look at the local circumstances on the ground, the reports of the mission, the consular caseload and trends that we see. We also consult with other partners who have different information on what's happening in the region, and we use the criteria for the different levels to apply the levels of risk.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's evaluated on a 24-7 basis. Updates are made throughout the night. For example, in cases of natural disaster or sudden emergencies, it's very important that Canadians have that information as quickly as possible, so we are continually reviewing the travel advice for all countries. We look at specific regions within the country so we can target advice in areas of a country that might be, for example, at a higher level of risk than others", " \n\xa0\nMr. Emmanuel Dubourg: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My last question is about the coronavirus. We know that Canadians will be brought back home quickly. It seems that a second airplane is planned.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If Canadians are in China but not in Wuhan, will they also be brought home? Are they on a list? If those people have contacted consular representatives, will they be part of the upcoming departures?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Our policy is to target our assistance to the needs of Canadians. In cases where there are commercial options to depart from a particular area, those provide the most expedient and easiest way to depart. Our evacuation support is restricted only to those cases in which Canadians really have no other options for leaving a particular area.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Each circumstance is different. In the case of Wuhan, obviously, we have a large concentration of Canadians who have made their needs known, and we're responding to those. There continues to be regular commercial traffic to and from the rest of China, and we will be monitoring the needs of Canadians as the situation progresses", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Emmanuel Dubourg: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Yip, you have the last minute', " \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0With respect to the coronavirus, is there adequate consular staff and planning to support the number of Canadians in the affected areas as well as the non-affected areas elsewhere in China?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather Jeffrey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes. You will have seen earlier this week that non-essential staff were drawn down from some of the missions in our China network. However, for us essential service?and the primary essential service in this context in China?is to provide consular services to Canadians.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We are increasing our consular staff and consular support in the China network, and full services remain available. We have a call centre staffed with over 50 people receiving calls on a 24-7 basis, and our emergency watch and response centre has been working shifts since the beginning of this crisis, fully staffed to respond to needs.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Calls come into the response centre, and we triage them so that our missions on the ground can respond to the most sensitive and difficult cases. We respond to requests for information through the call centre so that everyone can have consistent and timely information.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's a network that we're using to support, and it isn't just within China. It's also through our standing rapid deployment team, which is increasing the number of consular officers in China. We have also deployed on the ground to Wuhan, so actually our consular support is much more extensive than it was before this outbreak", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Ms. Jeffrey and Mr. Szwarc, thank you so much for appearing this morning.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We will now suspend and allow the witnesses to depart and the next set of witnesses to take their places.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The meeting is suspended.\xa0\xa0(1100)\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\xa0(1100)\xa0\xa0\n\n, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We'll come to order for our second hour.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We have witnesses from the Department of Justice to talk about extradition. We have Mr. Owen Rees, deputy assistant deputy attorney general; and Ms. Janet Henchey, senior general counsel and director general, international assistance group", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, on a point of order, could I ask the members to actually take their seats so we could hear the testimony? \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think members are now taking their seats, so I'll ask the witnesses to begin their 10-minute presentation", " \n\xa0\nMr. Owen Rees (Deputy Assistant Deputy Attorney General, Department of Justice): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Good morning.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for your invitation to provide a technical briefing to the committee on the extradition framework in Canada.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My colleague, Ms. Henchey, is senior general counsel and director general of the criminal law operations section. Ms. Henchey and her colleagues at the international assistance group are responsible for the administration of the Extradiction Act and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act on behalf of the Minister of Justice.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The IAG reports to the assistant deputy attorney general of the national litigation sector, whom I support. The national litigation sector is responsible for the conduct of litigation involving the Government of Canada or any department.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You'll see we've distributed a deck, which may assist you in following our presentation this morning.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Extradition is the process?, \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Just one moment.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, do we have that deck?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I certainly do. I think members may find it in the folder that's in front of them. I see you have it, Mr. Oliphant", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you. Sorry', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Carry on, please. We'll try not to have any further interruptions", " \n\xa0\nMr. Owen Rees: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Extradition is the process by which an accused or convicted person located in one country is surrendered to another country, pursuant to a request by an extradition partner, to face trial or the imposition or enforcement of a sentence. Extradition is an important tool of international cooperation used by Canadian and foreign police and prosecutors to fight serious crime at a global level.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Minister of Justice is responsible for the administration of the Extradition Act and the implementation of Canada's extradition agreements, and for dealing with requests for extradition to and from Canada. At the surrender stage, the minister must personally determine whether to order the person surrendered to the requesting state. The minister's authority under the Extradition Act is otherwise, in large part, delegated to legal counsel in the international assistance group, or IAG, a group within the Department of Justice. The IAG receives the request for extradition and the request for provisional arrest warrants, which are used in urgent circumstances to arrest a person before the extradition request is received. The IAG determines whether to seek a provisional arrest warrant and whether to proceed with an extradition request. In this function, the IAG's role can be likened to prosecutorial discretion and is not subject to political influence.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Canada may extradite only to an extradiction partner, which is defined in the Extradition Act as a state or entity with which Canada has a bilateral or applicable multilateral treaty, with which Canada has entered into a specific agreement, or whose name is listed in a schedule to the act. Canada has 51 bilateral extradition treaty partners, and there are 34 designated partners identified in the Extradition Act. Canada is also party to several multilateral conventions containing provisions on extradition, such as the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crimes, the United Nations Convention against the Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, and the United Nations Convention against Corruption. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There are three key stages to the extradition process in Canada. First is the issuance of the authority to proceed, the decision by the IAG exercising the delegated function of the minister to authorize the commencement of extradition proceedings before the Canadian courts. Second is the extradition hearing, which is also referred to as the judicial phase of the extradition process. Finally, there is the ministerial phase. This is the decision of the minister on whether to order the surrender of the person sought for extradition to the requesting state.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Having provided that general overview, I'll hand it over to my colleague, Ms. Henchey. , \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey (Senior General Counsel and Director General, International Assistance Group, Department of Justice): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We started by mentioning that there are three phases, but there is a possible preliminary phase, which is a request for a provisional arrest warrant. The Extradition Act and Canada's extradition agreements allow parties to apply for provisional arrest under urgent circumstances in order to avoid the flight of a particular person.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 In such circumstances, the provisional arrest, if it's approved through the issuance of an authority to arrest, precedes the other three steps. The material submitted to Canada by the requesting state in support of a request for provisional arrest is reviewed by the IAG, the international assistance group, acting on behalf of the minister. The IAG determines whether there is sufficient basis to proceed with this provisional arrest request and, if so, proceeds to request from a judge the issuance of a warrant.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 A provisional arrest warrant may be issued by a superior court judge if he or she is satisfied that there are grounds of urgency, the person is in Canada or on their way to Canada and a warrant for the person's arrest has been issued in the requesting state. Where a person has been provisionally arrested, the requesting state must submit a formal request for extradition within a specific period of time following the provisional arrest, and that period is specified in the applicable treaty. Otherwise, the person must be discharged from the extradition process.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When a formal extradition request is received, it is reviewed by the IAG to determine if it meets the requirements of the Extradition Act and the treaty. In assessing whether an authority to proceed should issue, the IAG will check that the request concerns extraditable conduct within the meaning of section 3 of the act. This means that the party seeking detention is an ?extradition partner?; that the person is being sought for prosecution or for the imposition of a sentence; that, subject to a relevant extradition agreement, the foreign offence in respect of which the extradition is requested is punishable by the extradition partner by imprisoning or otherwise depriving them of their liberty for a maximum term of two years or more; and that the alleged criminal conduct, had it occurred in Canada, would have constituted an offence in Canada.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As a matter of practice, the IAG also examines whether the request is likely to be successful at the extradition hearing and before the minister by looking at factors that are taken into consideration at those stages, such as the sufficiency of the evidence and the country conditions in the requesting state. If the IAG does issue the authority to proceed, this authorizes the commencement of the extradition proceedings before a superior court judge in the province where the person is located. The authority to proceed constitutes the authority of the judge to embark upon the hearing.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The extradition hearing, which is also known as a committal hearing, takes place before a superior court judge, who must decide whether to commit the person for extradition based on the evidence provided by the requesting state. Counsel for the Attorney General of Canada will file this evidence before the court at the hearing, normally in the form of something called ?the record of the case?, which is a certified summary of the evidence available in support of extradition. This is also provided to the person sought, in advance of the hearing. As Canada has an open court system, all materials filed before the courts are generally available to the public unless otherwise ordered by the court. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0At the hearing, the judge decides if the evidence presented on behalf of the requesting state by the Attorney General of Canada would justify a committal for trial in Canada had that conduct taken place here. This is known as the double criminality test. If the judge is satisfied that the evidence meets this test, he or she will order the person committed for extradition and the matter will move on to the ministerial phase. If the judge discharges the person from the extradition process, that concludes the proceedings.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0At the committal hearing, the counsel for the person sought may bring various motions, raise objections and seek additional time to prepare, all of which makes it difficult to predict how long any given extradition hearing will take to run its course. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Once the extradition hearing is concluded, if there's a committal it moves on to the ministerial phase, where the Minister of Justice must personally determine whether to order the person surrendered to the requesting state. The grounds on which the minister may order or refuse surrender derive from three sources: the Extradition Act, the relevant treaty or agreement and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Counsel for the person sought for extradition may choose to make written confidential submissions to the minister to assist him in making his decision. These submissions may be in respect of any ground that might justify a refusal of surrender or justify placing a condition on an order of surrender.\xa0\xa0(1115)\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The submissions made to the minister are not public, unless the minister orders the person's surrender and that person then seeks a judicial review of the decision. Then it would be filed in court", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You're at the 10-minute point. I'm going to ask you to try to wrap up relatively quickly, please", " \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The minister's decision balances the interests of the person sought against Canada's international obligations. He applies the mandatory and discretionary grounds of refusal in the Extradition Act. If the minister orders surrender, his decision is subject to judicial review in the provincial court of appeal. The decision of the extradition judge is also subject to appeal in the provincial court of appeal.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Finally, if the committal and the surrender order are upheld by the courts, it's possible to seek leave to appeal further to the Supreme Court of Canada. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's a basic overview of the process", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Godin, did you have a point of order?, \n\xa0\nMr. Jo?l Godin (Portneuf?Jacques-Cartier, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, Mr.\xa0Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As Canada is a bilingual country, all the documents in committee must be distributed in both official languages. However, I have received a document titled ?Extradition in Canada?. Perhaps a handling error has occurred, but unfortunately, I don't have the French version", ' \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That document is available in French. I believe we provided it in both languages', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Mr.\xa0Godin.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I don't see a French copy in my documents. I must advise the witnesses and all future witnesses that, if they want their documents to be distributed, they must provide them in both official languages. Documents should not be distributed if copies in both languages are not available.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On the same point of order, Mr. Albas", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It just seems to me, because I have two English copies that have been supplied here, that Mr. Godin's concerns are well founded", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0So do I. I presume that's an error, but I want to highlight again to witnesses that it's essential that if you want documents distributed, they have to be in both languages. We have the deck in both languages?I realize Mr. Harris is holding up the French language deck?but this document is only in English, as far as I can see. I think that's perhaps an error", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Owen Rees: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Chair, I think it is an error. I thought that the documents were submitted in both official languages. We will look into this for the committee', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The chair will ensure that no document is distributed until copies in both languages are available. That is paramount.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Mr.\xa0Godin. Go ahead', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Jo?l Godin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Rees, I appreciate your comment. I understand that, under the circumstances, there may be handling errors, and that is entirely legitimate. However, I want to let the committee and all the other committees know that I am making it my duty to preserve and defend the French language. At every opportunity, I will raise the flag to ensure that this request and rule in Canada is respected', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We will now continue with Mr.\xa0Oliphant', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Chair, may I ask that all the committee members return to the clerk their English copy of this document and that we continue with the two others until the document in question has been made available in French? It is not acceptable to have a document only in English', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Are we agreed to give the clerk copies of the document that was distributed only in English?[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Some hon. members: Agreed.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Chair: We're agreed on that, then. Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Albas, is this another point of order?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would just raise that there's an expectation that, when witnesses come, we try to have this. When it's the Government of Canada, and these are obviously documents that have been well vetted and whatnot, they should be sent ahead of time to make sure this doesn't happen. I do expect the Government of Canada to be able to meet our own standards here", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We'll begin with the questions.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mr. Warkentin, go ahead for six minutes", " \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin (Grande Prairie?Mackenzie, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I appreciate your coming today. I appreciate your opening statement. We'll have a few questions for you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Obviously we've talked broadly about the extradition process, but the extradition process in Canada is highlighted because of one case in particular, that of Ms. Meng, whom the majority of Canadians have heard of and a significant number of Canadians have opinions on.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I just want to clarify that in terms of her case, we are effectively at phase two of the process. Am I correct in that?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's correct", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Up until now, just to clarify, the process has been undertaken without any ministerial intervention. Is that correct?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The ministerial aspect of it is delegated to officials, and officials have conducted the analysis that led to the authority to arrest and the authority to proceed', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0So your testimony here today is that no government political intervention has been undertaken in the process up until this point', ' \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I can indicate that the authority to arrest and the authority to proceed were issued by officials without consultation directly with politicians', " \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0John Manley, the former Liberal minister, has spoken about his opinion that a prisoner exchange should be undertaken in this case. Has your department ever advised the government in consideration of any prisoner exchange at any point in history that you know of?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I can't testify to legal advice, but I can tell you that prisoner exchanges are a matter for the Department of Public Safety", " \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Your department, I would assume, would be consulted with regard to the legalities of such a suggestion. I would be curious, and I appreciate that the final decision would rest with them or that the request would rest with them, but has your department, to your knowledge, ever been consulted with regard to a suggestion of a prisoner exchange?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I repeat that I can't discuss legal advice", " \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In this case, who would suggest a prisoner exchange? You say it would be the Department of Public Safety. If a prisoner exchange was contemplated in a hypothetical case, who would initiate that discussion within government? These things don't just materialize. Somebody would suggest it. Where would that come from?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There is a piece of legislation related to the transfer of offenders. It applies to circumstances in which people are actually convicted of offences and serving sentences. That offender can bring an application to have their sentence transferred to be served in another country.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Prisoner exchange as a concept doesn't really exist in the law", " \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I don't expect you to give me legal advice in this public setting, but now I'm going to ask for it.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If I were the minister contemplating a prisoner exchange in the case of somebody who was mid-extradition process, someone who had not yet been charged in Canada but was possibly going to be considered for extradition to another country, what legal advice would you give me if I were the minister asking to see if that could be contemplated?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I can't give you legal advice. To be fair, I have no expertise in prisoner exchange", " \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm no lawyer and I'm no expert in terms of extradition or prisoner exchanges, but to me there appears to be no portion of the process that would allow for prisoner exchange to be considered for somebody who is mid-extradition. What would that do to the entire framework on which extradition is built? If we all of a sudden started to determine that we were not going to complete or fulfill our obligations under the treaties, what would that do to future extraditions? What would that do to the treaties?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First of all, the Extradition Act is what we call ?complete code?. It has all of the information in it that is required to begin and complete an extradition process. There is no reference in the Extradition Act to prisoner exchange, so it's not a concept known to extradition law. If we chose to put an end to an extradition proceeding in a way that was not contemplated by the treaty or the Extradition Act, that would be violating our treaty obligations", " \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What would be the repercussion for Canada if we didn't fulfill our obligations under the treaty?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I couldn't say for certain what the repercussion would be, but there would be a risk that it could bring the treaty to an end. It could vitiate the treaty", " \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Okay.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's strange to me that Mr. Manley would propose such an idea. He's a former minister of the Crown. That's interesting.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I appreciate your testimony", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Mr. Warkentin.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We now have Mr. Fragiskatos', " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos (London North Centre, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you to our witnesses.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, my colleague used the word ?strange?. What is strange is that the opposition, now in referencing Mr. Manley and earlier, I think, although he wasn't mentioned, Eddie Goldenberg, the former chief of staff to Prime Minister Chr?tien.... Mr. Manley was a minister when I was in high school. Mr. Goldenberg was chief of staff when I was in grade 6 or 7. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Let's stick to the facts. The facts, I remind my colleagues across the way, are that the Prime Minister has been unequivocal and our government has been unequivocal that a prisoner exchange is not something that is being considered or would be considered for a number of reasons. First and foremost, as Mr. Warkentin alluded to in his comments?he actually opened the door to this?it would set an awful precedent, so why would we go down that path? Individuals are free to write op-eds and contemplate different scenarios. If we're serious about policy, it matters what the Prime Minister has said. It matters what the government has said. The government has been very unequivocal in all of this. I think it's important to recognize that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To the witnesses, I'm interested in the technical issues surrounding extradition. Perhaps you could go through a few things for us non-lawyers on the committee just so we can understand them better. What type of information is typically sought in mutual legal assistance requests? You opened the discussion on that. What sort of information are we talking about?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mutual legal assistance is to assist prosecutors in different countries to access evidence for criminal prosecutions. There's a wide variety of things that could be sought to be of assistance in pursuing a prosecution. It could be witness testimony; it could be documentary information. A lot of the time it involves Internet service provider information, such as telephone records, texting records and email records. That's increasingly important in criminal prosecutions. It may be access to a particular item?a murder weapon, for example?that could be transferred across the border pursuant to a mutual legal assistance request. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Those are the general types of things. It could be anything, basically, that is relevant as a piece of evidence in a prosecution", " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm looking at the slide deck. Maybe the answer is obvious, but I still think it's interesting. On page 10, there's a wide gap, year over year, between the number of requests received and the number of requests made. Is there any information you could pass along as to why there is that gap? Is it just a matter of how the treaties work out?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think it's just a question of population. Canada is big geographically but relatively small in population. We have treaties with countries all around the world. If we add up all the crimes being committed around the world versus the crimes being committed in Canada, there will be more requests coming to us than requests that we'll be making", " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I thought so, but it's good to get that on the record.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Obviously, you cannot comment on the case of Ms. Wanzhou. I understand that, but Canadians are still following this issue along and do have questions. The issue of double criminality, that requirement, has come up. Can you tell the committee the purpose of this requirement in our law and about cases where the courts have said it is not satisfied?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The purpose of double criminality is the basic principle underlying extradition. A country does not want to send somebody from their territory to another territory to be prosecuted for something that they don't consider to be criminal. If a country has an offence that we would not recognize in criminal law, we wouldn't extradite somebody for it, and vice versa. This is applicable all around the world. All countries apply this principle of double criminality to extradition. It doesn't matter if you have exactly the same offence; it's the conduct we look at. If what the person did would be considered criminal in your country, then that will satisfy double criminality and will allow for the possibility of extradition", " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 With one minute left, could you tell us of cases where the courts have said that this has not been satisfied?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I don't have any examples directly in mind.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It happens very rarely, simply because we assess the evidence before we bring it before the court. We don't bring cases before the court if we think there's insufficient evidence for the judge to find double criminality.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Occasionally there might be a gap in the evidence where it doesn't quite meet the test for a particular offence. But as I said, it doesn't happen frequently", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the 20 seconds left, can I just ask this? In the course of a decade, how many people does Canada seek to extradite to other countries?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Then we'll go to Mr. Bergeron", " \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's a good question, which I'm not sure I can answer. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Perhaps you can get back to us on that", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could I get the breakdown of countries [Inaudible?Editor]?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Albas is also asking, if you have it, for the breakdown of countries that we've requested extradition from. If that's possible, please give that to the clerk later on. Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Monsieur Bergeron", " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I am interested by this concept of reciprocity regarding crimes committed in a foreign country, to potentially have an equivalent in the Canadian justice system. That of course applies to extradition cases, but also to cases of visa issuance or entry allowances for Europeans, among others.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0For example, we had the case of President Puigdemont of Catalonia, who was refused entry into Canada under the pretext that he was accused of a crime that, frankly, on a global scale, is a bit outdated: the crime of sedition. The authorities are apparently checking whether there is an equivalent in Canadian law.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Be that as it may, let's come back to the specific case we are discussing. I know that the first step is the International Assistance Group, which is in charge of determining whether a tentative order for arrest should be issued. In its assessment, does that service try to figure out what the equivalent in Canadian law is or does it simply receive the country's extradition request and decide whether it is justified, in which case it would go ahead with the extradition?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I can advise that when we receive a provisional arrest request, they provide us with a summary of the evidence. We don't get the actual evidence at that stage, just a summary. We assess whether or not, in our view, it would meet the criteria for double criminality. If it doesn't, then we wouldn't proceed to seek a warrant for provisional arrest", ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. It will be looked into. That is what I understand', ' \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We assess it before?, \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay', " \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The first step is to assess it and be satisfied that we think it's possible that this evidence is going to justify the issuance of an authority to proceed down the road and whether it meets the criteria for urgency that would allow a judge to issue a provisional arrest warrant. We review it, and in some cases we refuse to seek the warrant", " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0So the International Assistance Group looked at the fact that Meng Wanzhou is being accused of having violated U.S.\xa0sanctions against Iran, sanctions that Canada does not even apply. Under the circumstances, on what basis was it decided to follow up on this request of the United States?, \n\xa0\nMr. Owen Rees: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We can't discuss a specific case", " \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0But we can tell you that there was an authority to proceed issued, because that's public record. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The authority to proceed identifies an offence that we believe was made out on the evidence provided by the foreign state. The authority to proceed in the Meng case identifies the offence of fraud", ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. If I understand correctly, it is decided which of the charges provided by the country submitting the request could potentially apply under Canadian criminal law. I see that is a yes. So if some charges do not apply, but others do, a decision is made to extradite despite everything', " \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yes. We only have to be satisfied there is a Canadian offence that could be made out on the facts. We don't have to match all of our offences with the foreign offence. We look at the conduct and we ask, ?Is there a Canadian offence that arises from that conduct?? If so, we identify it and put it in the authority to proceed", ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Chair, if I have enough time, I want to come back to the issue of the proposal to exchange prisoners.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would like to remind our friend and colleague Mr.\xa0Fragiskatos that, when he talked about the opposition, I would have preferred if he had specified that it was the official opposition. Obviously, neither my colleague from the NDP nor I are associated with the comments that have been made so far. However, the fact still remains that this is a relevant issue insofar as, first of all, that idea seems to me totally unacceptable for at least three reasons.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First, they want to make a two-for-one exchange. That on its own seems totally unacceptable to me.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Second, since the beginning, Canada has consistently claimed that this process has to do with the rule of law. Since we are now in the second stage, which is the judicial stage, how could we bypass the judicial process in a so-called rule of law to reach a political agreement between the two countries? That is my second concern.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Third, it should be recognized that, on the surface, such an agreement between China and Canada would practically be an invitation to all authoritarian regimes of the world to imprison Canadians and then potentially have a prisoner exchange.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I know that this idea may have been stealthily considered by the government, although it has been categorically rejected since. I recognize this. Clearly, this idea seems totally unreasonable to me.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Does my analysis make sense to you?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Your time is up, Mr.\xa0Bergeron', " \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I can't really comment on that, but as I indicated earlier, the Extradition Act does not contemplate prisoner exchange", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Mr.\xa0Bergeron.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Harris', " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Chair. I have a series of technical questions.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You talked about three different phases, but as I see it, there are five processes going on: the decision whether to arrest somebody provisionally; the decision whether to issue an authority to proceed; the extradition hearing itself, which decides whether or not there's sufficient evidence to stand trial if it were an offence in Canada, which I call the preliminary inquiry standard; the decision by the Minister of Justice whether to surrender the individual; and an overriding process, which I call number five, which is the act that allows the minister to withdraw the authority to proceed ?at any time? and stipulates that ?if the Minister does so, the court shall discharge the person and set aside any order made?, under either ?judicial interim release or detention?.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Of these five processes, I take it that number one, the decision on whether to issue a warrant for arrest, is under the advice of the IAG, the internal group, not the minister. There's no political involvement even possible.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On the second one, the decision to issue an authority to proceed, you're saying that it's delegated by the Minister of Justice to departmental authorities. Is it true that the minister would have no opportunity to intervene or say anything about that? I understand that the officials carry out this assessment and make a determination, but is there no role for the minister even possible?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If I can go back to your first comment about the arrest, that is a decision made by the court. We bring an application to the court for a warrant", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Fair enough, yes, but the decision to ask for the warrant is made internally, is it not?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's right", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The minister doesn't decide whom to arrest, whom not to arrest or whom a warrant should be sought for", " \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's right, but the arrest can happen in one of two ways", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I understand. Let's say we have someone arrested. Between the arrest and whether or not something proceeds, there's this question of the authority to proceed", " \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's what I'm trying to explain. The authority to proceed sometimes precedes the arrest", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I understand that too, but that hasn't happened. If you have the provisional arrest, which we did in the particular case of Ms. Meng.... There was a decision, after she was arrested, as to whether to seek an authority to proceed or whether the authority to proceed would be issued.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There was a period of time, I think some 10 or 12 days or maybe more, during which we did hear from President Trump about some comments that he made. Between the time of the arrest and the time of issuance of the authority to proceed there was a period of time during which the authority to proceed was issued. You're saying that authority is delegated, but is that delegated in the sense that the minister cannot have any say in it whatsoever?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As a matter of practice, everything has been delegated in the Extradition Act. All the minister's discretion has been delegated to officials, with the exception of the decision to order surrender. That is done to insulate the minister for that very important decision he has to make at the end of the process and to ensure that he doesn't prejudge the outcome of that important decision.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0For that reason, the minister is not involved in the issuance of the authority to proceed and has never been involved in the issuance of authority to proceed", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is that a consistent practice?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's a consistent practice. , \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's important to know. I think we need to establish that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The first involvement of the Minister of Justice.... We're talking about the Minister of Justice here and not the Attorney General. They are two different hats, but the same person. We're talking about the Minister of Justice role. After the extradition hearing?which takes place if a decision is made that there's sufficient evidence to convict with a properly instructed court, etc. within Canada?the Minister of Justice has the decision to make as to whether to surrender the individual. That's a ministerial decision. Then what I call the overriding involvement or potential involvement is the act allowing the minister to withdraw the whole case.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Both of these decisions are, in the end, made by the Minister of Justice. Am I correct?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0No. You're correct about how you characterize the minister's decision. After the committal, if there's a committal at the extradition hearing, it goes to the minister. The minister then makes the decision about whether to order surrender, and it's the surrender order that will allow the person to be transferred to the foreign country making the request.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The withdrawal of the ATP is relevant only before the decision of the extradition judge. Once the extradition judge has ordered surrender, the ATP is used. It has been decided upon.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The withdrawal of the ATP is also delegated to officials, and that power exists in case something changes between the time the authority to proceed is issued and the time the extradition judge makes a decision on whether to order committal.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0For example, if the extradition partner withdrew their request after the proceedings had commenced, we could withdraw the authority to proceed and recognize that there was no longer a basis...or if something happened to the evidence that we had reviewed in order to issue the authority to proceed, and we no longer had confidence that there was sufficient evidence to justify a committal, we could withdraw the authority to proceed. That action is taken by officials in my department, in the international assistance group; it's not taken by the minister. , \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Can I ask an important question?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Harris, I'm sorry, but your time is up. I hope we will get back to you", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's the most crucial question", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Absolutely, and in fact I'm almost tempted?I wouldn't dare?to comment favourably on having another lawyer on the committee, but I'd better not do that", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I tried to slow her down, Mr. Chair. You saw that', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Albas, go ahead for five minutes', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, could I give a minute of my time just so I could hear Mr. Harris? I was going to go into this line of questioning', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Harris', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Mr. Albas.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The question was simple. You\'re suggesting that the overriding power of the minister, which says "at any time", is actually spent once the hearing is complete. The question then is, has that power, to your knowledge, ever been used?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That\'s a yes to the first part of your question. Once there\'s a committal, you can\'t withdraw the authority to proceed, but the minister still has the power to end the proceedings by discharging at his stage. The withdrawal of the authority to proceed is handled by officials, and that\'s prior to the committal decision. Then, once there has been a committal decision, the minister is making a decision on surrender. His decision could be to surrender or to discharge, and a discharge would bring the proceedings to a close', " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Has it ever been used?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, the minister has discharged, and yes, officials have withdrawn an authority to proceed in circumstances as I've described: where the evidence is no longer available or where the case has been withdrawn by the requesting state", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Harris encroached a tiny bit on Mr. Albas's time, but I think Mr. Albas is okay with that. , \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, I'll overlook that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you very much for your presence here today.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 In regard to that, could you supply the committee with the last time that kind of discharge process happened, just so we can see whether this has been used recently or if it's something that has happened only rarely in our history?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'd like to ask a little question about the Minister of Justice component. Obviously we are talking about the Minister of Justice and not the Attorney General, and therefore Shawcross doesn't apply in this case. Is that correct?, \n\xa0\nMr. Owen Rees: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, I'm not sure how to answer that question. We wouldn't be in a position to provide you with legal advice on the application of the Shawcross principle. I think I'll leave it at that", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Well, the treaty specifically in this process says, ?the Minister of Justice in his or her capacity?, not as Attorney General, or else it would say ?Attorney General?. In addition to the Minister of Justice receiving the decision of the court, when it moves to the ministerial phase can the Minister of Justice, in his or her capacity, be lobbied by other members of cabinet?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I can't speak to whether cabinet can lobby, but what I can tell you is that there are very limited matters that the minister should be considering in making his decision, and those are issues relevant to the extradition process: the treaty, the Extradition Act and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Extraneous issues that are relevant to the government in other contexts would not be relevant to the decision on an extradition case. , \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Again, though, to that, is it a cabinet order? Can the minister take the decision of the court to cabinet to solicit feedback in a formal mechanism? Or must the Minister of Justice, through another mechanism, like the Canada Gazette or something else, make that decision independent of cabinet? , \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The decision is made independent of cabinet and it's pursuant to the Extradition Act. The minister issues an order of either discharge or surrender. It doesn't go through the Gazette and it doesn't go through cabinet", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I only have a moment here. Media reports say that the Chinese government first found out about Ms. Meng's arrest from Huawei rather than the Canadian government. Can you comment on that?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You have 55 seconds", ' \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0No. I think that would be a question for Global Affairs', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That would be a question for Global Affairs, and we just had them here. Okay. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think we'll have them again, of course, some people from Global Affairs?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You know what, Mr. Chair? I think that's a great idea", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you. I mean that we'll have some people, whether it's those or others, but we'll figure that out, I'm sure", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm just glad to see that we have some multi-party support for that", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Oliphant', " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I'm going to actually pull on what Mr. Harris and Mr. Albas were questioning. I'm not a lawyer, so it takes me a little longer on this issue. I understand the ministerial decision on surrender and the basis on which that would be made under the act, under the particular bilateral treaty and under the charter issues, after a superior court has rendered its decision. That's one process. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On the ability of the minister after the authority to proceed, between that and the ultimate court decision, it sounds like if circumstances change, or if new evidence is presented, or an extradition request is withdrawn, that then allows the minister to stop the proceedings. I just want to make sure that I understand two things. What criteria are involved? What precedents are involved? Where does the burden lie on understanding how that decision would be made? Who makes that case and how does it happen?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The ability to withdraw the authority to proceed is provided for in the legislation. It has been delegated to officials in the international assistance group. The considerations are the same considerations that would exist in issuing the authority to proceed in the first instance. We would consider whether there's sufficient evidence and whether it meets the requirements of the particular treaty before we issue an authority to proceed.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If the considerations that were taken into account in issuing the authority to proceed change, and no longer exist the way they did at the time the authority to proceed was issued, that would be the basis for withdrawing the authority to proceed", " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is that a delegated decision as well, or is there nuance of difference between the delegation on the authority to proceed and the subsequent authority to not proceed?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0No, they're both delegated to officials", " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. That's the part that I've kind of been getting. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is that delegation by convention or is that the understanding our treaty partners have? Where does that lie?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's not an issue for treaty partners; it's an internal justice issue. That was determined when the legislation first passed. A decision was made that all of the discretion that was vested in the minister would be delegated to officials, with the exception of a decision on surrender, in order to insulate the minister, as I said earlier, so that he can be as independent as he possibly can be at that stage of the proceeding", " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I understand.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0After the final decision, to add a sixth thing to what Mr. Harris said, there's the potential appeal of the decision to the Supreme Court. It could go even six stages. Am I correct on that?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There are two levels of appeal. There's an appeal ?as of right? to the court of appeal of the province. It could be the British Columbia Court of Appeal or the Ontario Court of Appeal, depending on where the case is. That's an appeal from the committal. There's also a judicial review of the minister's decision. Those two things are heard together if they're both brought before the court of appeal. If the court of appeal upholds the decision, leave can be sought from the Supreme Court of Canada for a final appeal. Leave is rarely granted. It's granted only in cases of national importance", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This might be my last question, and I think I know the answer to it. Does the requesting country have any standing in any part of any of those six or seven processes? Do they have any rights in terms of making presentations?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0No. The requesting country does not appear in court in extradition cases. , \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Anywhere?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0No', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0So their only time is that under the treaty they request an extradition, and then it is up to our processes, following Canadian jurisprudence, following Canadian rule of law and following all of those things', " \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's correct", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have 18 seconds', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 No, no, we have a minute.... \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Sorry, I'm mistaken. There isn't a minute", " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm very good at keeping to my limit.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I suggest that to all members", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Well done. Thank you for assisting the chair and helping to keep me somewhat out of trouble.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Genuis', " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There's one issue that hasn't been discussed yet that I want to drill into a little bit. In 2016, the Prime Minister posted a joint statement suggesting that Canada had agreed to negotiate an extradition deal with China. That was partially walked back. There was some confusion, I think, in the discussion about whether the government at the time intended or did not intend to negotiate an extradition agreement with China. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could you just share with the committee whether there was a plan at the time? What was the context for the Prime Minister saying that they were considering negotiating an extradition agreement with China?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Of course, I can't speak on behalf of what the Prime Minister meant, but I can tell you that there was an agreement with officials that we would consider the possibility of an extradition treaty. It was something less than agreeing to negotiating a treaty. There were discussions undertaken to consider whether we would negotiate a treaty", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. This is maybe where.... There were discussions to consider. Did those discussions to consider involve discussions between Canadian officials and Chinese officials to start to map out what that agreement could or would look like?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 There were discussions between Canadian and Chinese officials about the Chinese interest in negotiating a treaty', " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. They were interested in a treaty. There were discussions between Canadian and Chinese officials about it, and the Prime Minister said, according to the statement, that we would be willing to negotiate this treaty. Meetings took place after that, I assume, between Canadian and Chinese officials. What happened next in terms of those discussions?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Again, I can't speak to what the Prime Minister said or didn't say. I can tell you that there was an agreement between officials that there would be discussions, and discussions took place. Where that fits into what you're describing as a statement from the Prime Minister, I can't tell you", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. After that agreement, there were discussions between officials about this. There weren't just discussions about having that statement, but there were discussions after the statement about next steps. That's what I understand you're saying", ' \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There were preliminary discussions about whether we might be interested in negotiating a treaty. No treaty has been negotiated', " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Right. Are those discussions still going on?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0They were not formal discussions, so they didn't formally commence or formally end. It would be possible to continue to have discussions", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0So you haven't at any point gotten policy direction from the government to cease to have those discussions", " \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This wasn't a policy direction from the government. It was an agreement between officials to have a discussion. There was no formal mandate from the government to negotiate a treaty", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay, but the Prime Minister said publicly that this was happening. Of course, you can't answer for what he said or didn't say, but presumably officials note it when the Prime Minister makes a statement like that, and it shapes what actions are then taken.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is it your understanding that the rules of engagement vis-?-vis that extradition agreement as they existed in 2016 continue to apply, or have there been subsequent statements from the political level contradicting that or changing that direction?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There's never been any formal mandate to negotiate a treaty with China. That hasn't changed", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay, but an informal mandate to have conversations.... I'm just trying to understand this so that people watching at home can get a sense of it, because the Prime Minister did say.... There was a joint statement, and clearly when there is a joint statement saying that we're prepared to move forward with this, that influences what next steps are taken or not taken by officials", " \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I don't have anything more to say, other than that we don't require a formal mandate to have preliminary discussions about whether a country might be interested in a treaty. These kinds of discussions happen among officials, between Canada and a number of different countries?, \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay, but?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To negotiate a treaty, we would require a formal mandate, and we don't have one", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When was the last time that informal conversations happened between Canadian officials and Chinese officials on the possibility of an extradition agreement between the two countries?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Very briefly, please', " \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm sorry. I don't have that answer", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could you come back to the committee with an answer in writing? Is that part of the...?, \n\xa0\nMs. Janet Henchey: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm not sure if I can even get you an answer, because the discussions could have taken place between officials from my department or they could have taken place from officials in Global Affairs.... I'm not sure I can give you a?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Henchey, perhaps you could check on it. I'm going to ask you, if you can, to do so.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Albas, you have a point of order, perhaps, because we are at the end of the time", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I do realize that, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's just that you had asked earlier about a breakdown of extraditions by country and how many get done. If it's possible, could the department also include how many extradition agreements of those lists are with countries that have the death penalty? I think that would be reasonable", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Fragiskatos', " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, I do have a point of order. Just to add to the comments or the questions put forward by Mr. Genuis?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is it a point of order or debate?, \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Perhaps this would add to our understanding. According to a 2016 National Post article?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Fragiskatos, this is not a point of order. It sounds like it's debate, and I think we're.... We may have occasions to debate in the future, but I'm sorry, I don't think it's a valid point of order.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would like to point out that the committee members have now received copies of the document ?L'extradition au Canada?, which the clerk had distributed in only one language today.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0However, I must advise future witnesses that, if they want documents to be distributed, they will have to provide them in Canada's both official languages", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Owen Rees: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr.\xa0Chair', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to thank our witnesses very much for appearing today.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I also want to remind colleagues that we're meeting tomorrow night from 5:30 to 7:30 with Ambassador Barton.

['[\n\xa0\nThe Chair (Hon. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.)): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Colleagues, this meeting of the Special Committee on Canada-China Relations will come to order.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Harris, I understand you have a point of order', " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris (St. John's East, NDP): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, Chair. Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 At a meeting on January 30, we asked the government to produce a list of the 14 countries it had indicated were in support of our position on, and concern about, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. Fourteen countries have publicly endorsed Canada's position, as well as an unnamed number that have not offered their names publicly. The committee was offered a list of these and I'm wondering if that has been produced yet. I believe it was Mr. Thoppil who offered to do that. Has it been made available to the committee yet?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Let me check with the clerk.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We received several documents at 4 p.m. today that will be distributed tomorrow morning. I'm not sure whether that is one of them. The clerk will check on that. Hopefully, we can have an answer to that question before the end of the meeting, or perhaps at the end of the meeting.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Colleagues, before us today we have His Excellency Ambassador Dominic Barton, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Canada to the People's Republic of China. With him, from the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development, is Mr. Shawn Steil, executive director, Greater China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ambassador, you'll have 20 minutes for your opening statement, followed of course by questions", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton (Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Canada to the People's Republic of China): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair and members of the committee. I know that you're taking on very important work, and I'm very honoured to be able to come and talk to you today.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to spend just two minutes on the coronavirus. I know that the minister has already talked a lot about it. We have 373 Canadians seeking assistance to leave Hubei province. The 211 on the flight manifest should be leaving tomorrow at about noon, with the weather and all that stuff being in our favour. Then we're looking at other options, whether relating to other countries' planes or to having our own plane coming in. We have eight consular people on the ground, because there are a lot of complications in moving people. We've also set up a call centre in the Beijing embassy in case people have a lot of questions about getting water, food and so forth in that environment. I'd be happy to talk to more about that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The other comment I would make is that the Government of Canada, working through the Canadian Red Cross, has also provided protective medical equipment to China. That was sent yesterday. They're en route and will be heading right to Hubei. I would just echo what's being said at the World Health Organization. I commend what China is doing in trying to contain this and the effort that's under way on that front.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In September of last year, Prime Minister Trudeau appointed me as ambassador. I've basically been in the role for about four and a half months. I was in Beijing at the end of September on the same day that the new Chinese ambassador came here. As I think you well know, my career has been in the private sector all the way through. I'm honoured to be given the opportunity to serve my country, and that's to promote and defend Canada's interests and values. I hope it's to also help China better understand Canada, and Canadians to better understand China. I want to say also that the utmost priority of my goal and objectives is to work for the release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, and to seek clemency for Robert Schellenberg. That's right in the headlights, and I think about that every day.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In December 2018, Canada's relations with China fundamentally changed, and that was following the arrest of Madam Meng. We can talk about all the consequent acts, but there was a massive change. Things had been actually moving quite well. The chill is real. I'm committed to working hard to resolve the challenges we face in that bilateral relationship, to try to restore our relationship, but critical to that will be the release of the two Michaels and clemency for Robert Schellenberg. The Chinese side is also very angry about where they are, so we have lots to work through. Resuming regular high-level dialogue between our governments and strengthening our channels of communication, which, again, had been broken, are key early aspects of what I've been trying to do in China. Although we've had some success in this regard, many of our regular dialogues, especially the ministerial ones, have not resumed since December 2018.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to say a little bit about my background. I lived in China for six years. I was based in Shanghai, working around the country. I've been in Asia for about 12 years. I've had consistent engagement with China. It's actually been mainly with the university sector and some cities. That's been my primary area of interest. I definitely do not pretend to have the answers to all of the issues and on the complex, diverse relationship, but I will try to do my best to give you my lens as to how I see it and what we're up to.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0More specifically, there are four things I want to cover quickly: one, a bit of the context on what's happening in China; two, the nature of our relationship today; three, our current presence and what that looks like; and four, probably most importantly, my mandate and the priorities that the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs are asking me to pursue.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First, on the context, I know that you don't need lots of stories about how big China is, how important it is, and so forth, because I think you well know that. All I would say is that I think we've seen over the last 15 years, and it's accelerating, an economic power shift towards Asia and a geopolitical shift towards Asia, with China very much at the centre. In terms of global GDP growth, 28% to 30% is coming from China. While that's going to be affected by the coronavirus, it's going to be back.\xa0\xa0(1740)\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It's the second-largest consumer market in the world and the largest protein market in the world for meats, but also for vegetable-based protein, so it's a very important market for us. As we look at it, it's the largest energy market in the world, particularly as it relates to renewables. On that side, I could go on.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We are not very relevant in that market. China imports about $2.1 trillion; that was the 2018 number. We have about 1.3% of that. Over the last 25 years, we've lost share in that. We've been growing, which is great, but we've been losing share as we go through it.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I look at China as 22 clusters of cities. It's just too big to look at as one country. Canada is probably relevant in three of those 22 clusters in where we are. There's a lot of potential?a lot of opportunity?for us as we look ahead. I believe this growth will continue with the urbanization and the push to the service sector as we go through it.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Understanding the history and culture I think is critically important. I'm not about to try to talk in detail about that. I just want to register it. In the 3,000-plus years of history, you can learn a lot about how China thinks about priorities, how they make decisions and their values as they go through it.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0For example, on the values side, I think it's important to understand?and it's not to say that we agree with it, because we have a different point of view?where they're coming from. They place an importance on the values of collectivism and harmony, owing to a Confucian heritage. Understanding the extent to which China values unity and the needs of society at large, rather than freedom of individual choice...we just have to understand that. That's where they're coming from. It can help us understand the trade-offs they make. It does not mean that we agree with what they do and where they are at; it's about understanding. You can see that in the history.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0While I talked about all of the growth and the opportunities and so forth in China, they face very significant challenges. They have a huge issue on poverty going on. There is a very poor part of China. It's a rich and poor country. That's a very big focus of the government?eradicating poverty. They have millions who are still below the international poverty line.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The environment is a big push for them. China has the world's second-highest number of pollution-related deaths, after India. There's been a lot of improvement, but a lot of work needs to be done there.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In terms of demographics, it is a very rapidly aging society, like Canada's, but obviously on a different scale. There are about 260 million people over the age of 60; I don't think it's that old, but it is getting older. That's going to go up to 483 million. That has a huge impact on productivity and on health care costs and lifestyle. Canada has a lot of capability on that side, on the research and in many other dimensions.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Their investment efficiency is dropping. It takes double the amount of investment to get a single unit of output, which has put challenges on their growth model and on their financial system, which is now, by any respect, the second-largest in the world. They now have to worry more about stability, and I think Canada can provide a lot.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 They have lots of big issues that they have to work on, besides obviously pandemics and so forth that come up, so it's just to understand the challenges....\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On our relationship, the history of our relationship is actually quite unique. They remind me of that almost every time I see someone senior. They're serious about it. They actually go back to missionaries who were in China in the 1870s and 1890s in places such as Chengdu and Chongqing and who established schools and established hospitals. They're revered to this day. Actually, they used to not talk about missionaries. You can now talk about missionaries, and it's due in large part to what Canadian missionaries have done.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There's Norman Bethune. Everyone probably knows about Norman Bethune and the role he played as a doctor in helping Chinese soldiers in World War II. He is completely an icon to the younger generation today.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There is our support for Hong Kong during World War II, when 554 Canadians died trying to defend Hong Kong and 500 Canadians were wounded. That is remembered every year as a joint effort in trying to fight fascism.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There are our wheat sales in 1958 all the way into the 1960s. Against a view in the world where people wanted to isolate Communist China, we provided wheat.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Then there is our diplomatic recognition in 1970, almost a decade before the United States'. They remember that.\xa0\xa0(1745)\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 All of that said, it's nice to have a history, but there are limits to what that gets us in terms of influence. I'm going to come back to this, because I believe we need to have influence, but having influence means that you have to have some relevance in the system. There is only so far that those historical links can get us there. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Regarding our presence in China, I'm not going to go into the details; these are just facts. We have roughly 650 people in greater China, 150 of those are Canadian-engaged staff and about 500 are locally engaged staff who we shouldn't forget. We obviously have the embassy in Beijing, but also consulates general in Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Hong Kong. Then we have a secondary network of trade missions in 10 cities, spread across the country. Then there is the provincial-level involvement that goes on from provinces, which is very important, and some municipal linkages. Those ties are very important, especially when we have challenges such as this. Having wires that are not just at a national level help allow dialogue in what we're doing. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Getting to my mandate and priorities in discussions with the Prime Minister and then with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the overall objective is to restore the relationship, but with three priorities, and I would argue, one very important caveat that's in that. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First and foremost is to secure the release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, and get clemency for Robert Schellenberg. That is core; that's a priority.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Second is to promote and protect human rights. That is a sine qua non. It has to be everywhere. It's not something you put to the side while you do it. I want it in the headlights of what you do. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Third is to look at how we can deepen and broaden the relationship. That's the people-to-people ties, not just the government ties. It's the arts, it's the sports, it's the universities. There are lots of other wires and linkages in there. Then it's the economic ties, because there are significant opportunities in many sectors, but particularly in five or six. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Those are the keys to resolving this bilateral tension and restoring trust. I think Canadians want to engage, but on the basis of doing it with international rules and principles that provide predictability and security. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's what I'm trying to do.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What I will say about the dark periods when it's a very tough discussion is that when I was presenting my letters of credence to President Xi, I told him what my priorities were. He said that in restoring a relationship like this, it takes two sides, that there are things we need to do and there are things they need to do. There is clearly a lot of work there. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On the bilateral tensions and the first priority around the safe and timely return to Canada of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig and securing clemency for Robert Schellenberg?as it is in all the death penalty cases in other countries?I am limited by privacy in what I can say. I've seen each of them a number of times as I've gone through it. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The comment I would just want to make?and I'm not used to doing this type of thing?is that I am unbelievably inspired by their resilience. Each of these three people is incredible, as a human and as an individual. I want to say that. That's how I mark my time in China, by my visits that I do to see them. It's not usual for ambassadors. They typically will do one. Every single time I am allowed to visit, I'm going to go.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I, and we, consistently and constructively engage with the Chinese government on their cases and I hope our efforts are soon going to bear fruit. We have to try all different means. We are working closely with other governments, particularly the United States, but also like-minded partners, to try to unlock this, but also to maintain awareness of the issues as this also impacts other countries.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I know this continues to be top of mind for the Prime Minister and is the reason he has repeatedly said that Canada will only respond to this situation in a manner that upholds our values and respect for the rule of law. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My discussions with fellow ambassadors in Beijing have given me insights into what other countries have gone through, because others have gone through this and experienced significant strains in their relationship, and I'm happy to talk more on that.\xa0\xa0(1750)\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Again, resolving this issue is critical for us to be able to move to a restored relationship with China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Promoting and protecting human rights is extremely important and is emphasized to me all the time by the Prime Minister, that it be reinforced no matter what position we are in.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As I mentioned when it comes to values, we have different views on these. That said, we believe that human rights are universal and inalienable, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated. This is why we believe it's important to hold the Chinese government accountable, as we do with all governments, to these principles in its own international and domestic commitments. For example, our government has expressed deep concern over time with China's human rights record, particularly recently in the province of Xinjiang, but also in other parts of the country.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Journalists, diplomats and Chinese civil society representatives I have spoken to agree that 2019 witnessed an increased crackdown on dissent and on expressions of disagreement about China's human rights record, within and outside the country. The Government of Canada is concerned that China's crackdown on dissent is increasingly extending beyond China's own borders. Whether it's in international forums, such as the UN, or domestically Canada continues to emphasize the value of universal human rights as defined by the United Nations.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As I mentioned, our government is concerned by the credible reports of the mass detention, repressive surveillance and family separation affecting Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, under the pretext of countering extremism, terrorism and separatism. As ambassador, I will continue to raise these issues with Chinese authorities, which I have done, to release Uighurs and other Muslims who have been detained arbitrarily.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Canadians are also becoming more worried about how all of this touches them, as I see in the opinion polls. Charting a way forward in our relations with China has to ensure that we're following the rules and norms of engagement that we all respect.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On deepening and broadening the relationship, we do have frank, difficult discussions with the Chinese government. They do that with us because they're also very concerned with us.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0China is more than about government. Many other different relationships are going on in the country, and so it's very important that we deepen and broaden them. They help with resilience and they also help strengthen the relationship. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We've been looking at three areas in particular. One is the fabric, the people-to-people ties, linking everything from art to education, business and communities. One example is that when I've had conversations with party secretaries in cities and they have been very icy at the beginning and then we have one glass of baijiu with them and find out that the party secretary's son or daughter has gone to Western or McGill, and they're very proud of that linkage. There's a linkage in the system with Canada that people know. Our alumni in China who have gone to Canadian universities are, I think, an underutilized asset.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would love to talk more about promoting trade and investment. I probably should shut up and move on, but I'm very excited by the opportunity we have on many fronts.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I also think we need to build our China competencies more, given the significance of China over the next 100 years. Whether you like China or don't, it is going to play a very important role and we need to build our capabilities, not just on the government side but also in our communities and with our children to understand how this system works. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In conclusion, obviously none of this is easy or straightforward. There's a new adventure almost every week in this.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As a country we need to digest this complexity and the significance of China and how it impacts our interests. In the short term, this means defining our Canadian interests very clearly and identifying where these interests are shared by China so that we can work together on common objectives, and there is a large common objective agenda that we can work on together.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It also means identifying our red lines, where compromise is not possible. Friends disagree with each other; friends get mad at each other, so we need to define where those are and make sure people understand them.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We need to manage both these opportunities and challenges in concert. It's a notion of walking and chewing gum at the same time. We can engage and grow, and we can also be tough at the same time.\xa0\xa0(1755)\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Again, to be able to do this, at the beginning we need to resolve the current bilateral challenges in securing the release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor and gaining clemency for Robert Schellenberg. I don't think we're alone in this challenge. Many countries are facing this. I just hope we take a long-term approach in how we do it and don't bounce around over time. We need a long-term approach. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for listening to me", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Ambassador.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Our first questioner today is Mr. Genuis', " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood Park?Fort Saskatchewan, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I do want to say at the outset, with greatest respect, that I felt at the time of your appointment and still feel that you are a completely inappropriate choice as ambassador. That's not because of your personal qualifications. It's because, as you said today, we expect our diplomatic corps to defend our interests and our values. I look at the track record with McKinsey and some of the things it was involved in, and those raise big red flags for me in terms of your position now as the representative of Canada defending our interests and our values.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0At the time you were in charge of McKinsey, from 2009 to it's my understanding that you advised almost two dozen Chinese state-owned companies. According to The New York Times, one of those companies was the China Communications Construction Company. Could you confirm for me, first of all, that McKinsey did work for the China Communications Construction Company while you were there?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'd have to check that out. I'm happy to agree to that if you read it in The New York Times", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Would you prepared to submit to this committee a list of all of the Chinese state-owned companies that you did work for at McKinsey?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, what I would need to do is.... McKinsey's pretty careful about client confidentialities. I'd be happy if there were some mechanism so that it isn't in the public domain but that some people could look at it. I'm open to that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What I would remark, though, is that, first of all, I'm very proud of my career and time in the private sector and with McKinsey and the work that we did. That firm has worked with many companies around the world. We're known for telling truth to power and calling it out as it is", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. You're proud of that, and we know that, and I think it's important that it's on the record.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When you signed the China Communications Construction Company as a client in 2015, they were still under World Bank sanctions because of the corruption and bid-rigging they engaged in in the Philippines. Would you have been aware that they were under sanctions when you signed them on as a client?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, what I would say is that McKinsey has over 3,000 clients that we work with. I'm not familiar with that at all. I wasn't involved. I wasn't doing any client work. I was based in London at the time. I'm not looking at that, so I'm just not familiar with the details of that", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You were in charge of McKinsey, though, and you were setting, I assume, broad policy direction. For example, McKinsey was advising a company that was carrying out the Chinese government's policy of building militarized islands in the South China Sea. Was it your position that those islands are a violation of international law?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, what I would say is that I am not familiar at all with our being involved in designing the islands in the South China Sea. If you want to talk to someone at McKinsey to find out more information, I'm sure we'd be happy to get someone to talk to you about it", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay, let me just back up a second, then. In terms of your position now, do you agree with the Permanent Court of Arbitration's ruling that China's program of construction of militarized islands in the South China Sea violates international law? Do you agree with that?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would follow the policy of what the government does. I think the Canadian government respects international opinions, but we don't have a view on maritime issues. I'd have to look at what our policy is on that. I don't?, \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay, but you're Canada's ambassador to China, so you're a spokesman for our policy on China. It's your job to communicate that policy to Canadians and to the Chinese government. If you were asked in a meeting with a Chinese official whether our view is consistent with the Hague tribunal's view, would you agree, yes, that the tribunal is right, that these islands violate international law?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 First of all, what I would do on that is that I wouldn't make up an answer. I would actually go and look to see what we do.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would probably ask to get back to them on it because I am not familiar with all of the pieces. Canada opposes unilateral actions that escalate tensions and undermine stability in the international order, so...", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's a simple policy question. It's interesting that you're not briefed on the answer to what is.... I think everybody around this table knows what's happening in the South China Sea, that it's a violation of international law.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You may not remember, but your company was involved in advising the China Communications Construction Company at a time when they were working on this very project in violation of international law", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, could I just interject for a second?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I said that there is a very different point you make that the company was involved while this was happening. It doesn't mean that McKinsey was advising on that, so you need to find out more?, \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0But you were in charge of the company, sir. It's like when the Prime Minister says, ?Oh, I didn't do it. It was a functionary in the bureaucracy.? The buck has to stop somewhere and you were running the company, so you were setting the policy direction. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It wasn't just in China. It wasn't just state-owned companies. You know of the case in Saudi Arabia where a report that was prepared identifying critics of the Saudi government led to their being punished in the crackdown. There were so many different cases, when you were in the leadership of McKinsey, of just gross problems in terms of co-operation with gross abusers of human rights. Your response to these questions is to say that you don't know, you don't remember and you weren't responsible, when you were the guy running the show. It doesn't give me a lot of confidence that you, running the show as ambassador?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you. I'm sorry, but you've exceeded your time.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ambassador, I'm afraid you'll have to wait for an opportunity if you wish to respond to that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We're on to Mr. Fragiskatos. , \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos (London North Centre, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Ambassador, for being here.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In 2015 you co-authored a piece for the Center for International Relations and Sustainable Development and there was a quote in it that stood out to me. In fact, it mirrors what we heard in your comments in many ways, but I'll read it to you. It says: ?The world is re-balancing towards Asia, and China in particular; Canada must re-balance with it.?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Can you highlight for us the importance of this relationship?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I know you've taken time to do that in your opening statement, but this is a fundamental relationship for Canada?now and in the future. At least that's my view and I think the view of most people in this country.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could you expand on that?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Sure.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think that Canada is a small trading nation. We're a G7 country, but we depend on trade and we depend on trading with large markets, and one of the absolutely largest markets in the world is China and it's going to become the largest market. For Canada's future prosperity, I think it's very important that we be there.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The thing I find most exciting about it is that there is a neat overlap in what we have, and not just in terms of natural resources, which is obviously an important area and where we could do more, but also in terms of our brain power, our regulatory approaches and our financial services, and I could go on. There is a neat overlap.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This will create many jobs. It will allow Canadians with ideas and innovative thoughts to be able to expand them into bigger markets, and it's something the whole country can participate in. Again, China needs a lot of things that we have and I think we could play an even more influential role in how that economy and society evolves", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I acknowledge everything you\'ve said, but I think the word you used in your statement was ?chill?. We are in a very difficult moment in the relationship.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Do you have any thoughts on what\'s worked and what hasn\'t when other states have had challenges with China? Are there any lessons learned that can be applied, particularly the experience of liberal democracies, that stand out and would be quite appropriate? Is there anything we can learn as a lesson from that and apply it to the current situation?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, I\'ve spent a lot of time with ambassadors from other countries who have gone through this. You think about Norway, Japan, Singapore, and I can go on. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think there are a couple of lessons learned. I think one is not to be bullied. It is to stand up for what we believe in and what we\'re going to do.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Number two is to maintain a long-term perspective, to think about the broader relationship, to continue to engage. There are a number of cases where the engagement stopped and it took a long time to get back. The lesson learned from talking with that ambassador and with the government there is that they would have continued to engage. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think it\'s being clear about what you want to do. It\'s continuing to engage and build and look for relationships to engage others to help you in that process.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Those would be a couple of things I would suggest. , \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 On that point about engagement, if you read the Globe and Mail, for example, there have been a number of op-eds calling?and it\'s not just politicians?for a much more confrontational approach. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0However, you\'ve pointed to the need to continue to engage Beijing, and the fact?as you\'ve highlighted here today?that positives can come out of engagement. Can you talk about how that could help to overcome the current impasse we\'re in? , \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It is important to engage. I remember clearly, from talking to Singaporeans, that you need to have some relevance to be able to get things done. It\'s not just the economic relevance; it\'s the trust and linkages that people have built in what they\'re doing.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I think it\'s important to do that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I know there are different views. I know there are views about, "Let\'s go hard line, and let\'s cut everything off.? The question there is to be prepared for what you ask for in that type of an approach. I don\'t think we have to go that way. There are a lot of reasonable people we can interact with. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Again, what I\'ve learned and heard from other countries that are going through similar processes is that engagement is important. , \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That is not to the exclusion of human rights then', " \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Absolutely not. As I said, you can be very strict and strong in how you feel and say it. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Some might say, ?We're in the freezer box in terms of our linkage, so why would you even say anything?? I think that's exactly the time to say it. We're not going to stop. It's there. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's important, because when we re-engage, we want to make sure we're re-engaging in the right way, for the long term. That's something that the Prime Minister feels very strongly about. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You have five seconds", " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In five seconds, you talked about common objectives where we can work together. I quoted directly from your opening statement. If there is another round, I'd like to ask you more about that. I think that's really important to emphasize. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's not to minimize at all the current challenges we're facing. Of course, Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor are facing real difficulties, and their families are concerned, as are Canadians. However, we have to keep in mind the importance of the relationship as well. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you Mr. Fragiskatos. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Monsieur Bergeron. , \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron (Montarville, BQ): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you, Mr.\xa0Chair. Your Excellency, thank you for joining us today.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You said at the start that you take every opportunity to meet with Canadian citizens who are currently detained. Please convey our thoughts to them. All the members of this committee are deeply concerned about their situation. I would greatly appreciate it if you could express to them our solidarity regarding their situation at this time.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Chair, I won't hide my unease with the way that the work of this committee is proceeding. Quite honestly, it seems that the worst thing to do, under the current circumstances, is to undermine the credibility of the person representing Canada before the Chinese authorities.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On the contrary, Your Excellency, I believe that your experience and your work to date amply qualify you for your sensitive mission. We need only look at the fact that, as soon as you were appointed, the downward spiral in relations between Canada and China came to a halt. Fairly quickly, we were able to restore pork exports to China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Some may say that the Chinese had no other choice because domestic production, given the swine flu, wasn't enough to meet the demand. However, the fact remains that there was a change in attitude. I know that your visits with detained Canadians are having a very positive impact. I want to thank you for this.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This brings me to my question. Your presence in China, in addition to your calibre as a person, your experience and your knowledge of Chinese cultural dynamics, has had all the effects that I just described. Isn't this the most tangible proof that the Government of Canada should have acted much faster to appoint an ambassador to Beijing, rather than waiting eight months during this long crisis before filling the position?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mr. Chair, thanks for the comments and the questions. It is much appreciated, and I will definitely pass on the remarks to Michael Spavor, Michael Kovrig, and also Robert Schellenberg. It means a lot to hear that this committee is hearing how people feel about that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0With regard to the question of appointing an ambassador, I wasn't part of the process. What I would say is that the fact that both ambassadors were appointed at the same time is a small step, but it was a signal that we wanted to be able to move forward.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What I would say is that this chill in the relationship.... We're angry. We're very angry because of our people have been taken. China is very angry as well?furious. We're both furious. I'll just say that the first conversation I had there was probably one of the most unpleasant conversations I've ever had. I mean, the shaking and anger from there, and we were also.... So it wasn't a conversation; it was a two-way reading of things.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The dynamic was such that the government was trying to reach out. There wasn't any response in terms of where things were. There wasn't even a basis to have a discussion. It was really in Osaka that the Prime Minister, because of alphabetical order, was sitting beside the president and could say, ?We have to get through this?. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I hope now that we do actually have some channels and can now have real conversations where we can interrupt each other, where we cannot just be angry, but can actually try to be constructive", " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you, Mr.\xa0Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We may have the opportunity to look back at the sequence of events that led to the arrest of Meng Wanzhou and at the ripple effect on Canadian citizens. We'll certainly look at that again.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have two very simple questions.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First, to your knowledge, before making the decision to authorize the incarceration of Meng Wanzhou, did the Canadian government seek advice from the embassy?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Second, given the similar case of the Garratt couple in 2014, shouldn't we have been warned of what might happen?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Please be very brief, Ambassador", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mr. Chair, on that one, I'm not aware of the actual conversations. I think the justice department came to sort of explain the process yesterday?before and how the process worked?but I wasn't part of those discussions on where it was, so I wouldn't be able to answer that", ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, but from what you know?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Bergeron, your time is up. You may be able to continue later. Thank you', ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Harris', " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Ambassador Barton, for your opening remarks.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to echo Mr. Bergeron's comments and acknowledge your extraordinary efforts on a personal level in personally visiting Mr. Kovrig, Mr. Spavor and Mr. Schellenberg and offering them your support. It is very meaningful, and I've heard words to that effect, so thank you for doing that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You were appointed, of course. I want to go into the effectiveness of some of the efforts internationally. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We may have a second round, Mr. Chair, and I hope we will in order to do some of that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You were appointed only recently, in the middle of an election. You haven't appeared before a committee before, and this is the first opportunity for us to listen to you and to raise some things that have been raised in the public domain, of which I'm sure you're aware. As late as today, we had a release from Democracy Watch that suggests that your holdings, your history, your current holdings, those of your wife and her involvement in investments in the Asia-Pacific region give rise to a conflict of interest.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I don't want to get into blind trusts and any of those things because they are detailed and, potentially, would lead to a big discussion. I do just want to ask you this question because Canadians deserve an answer. What do you say to Canadians as to whether they should feel comfortable with you in this role, given the fact that it's been suggested that these involvements would lead you to be open to influence, given the suggestion that perhaps, consciously or unconsciously, your own approach and attitude in dealing with the Chinese on the issues may be influenced by your personal interests?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What do you say to Canadians about that criticism and that allegation? I want to give you an opportunity to respond to that", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The first thing I would say is that my integrity matters a lot to me. It matters a huge amount to me. What people say, or say I'm doing, matters. I've lived my life with the highest integrity. So at a personal level, I would just say that. There's a track record of people I've interacted with and worked with on that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The second is that I've been extraordinarily diligent with the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner. From the very beginning, before this even happened, I said that I am proud that my wife works and this is a situation you need to be aware of. I was very transparent about any of the issues that I have, and so forth. I've tried to be up front about that and transparent on everything I've been involved in on it.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The third thing I would say is that from a financial point of view, I think it was John Manley who said, and I agree, that this is the stupidest economic decision I could have made in my life. I didn't do it for an economic reason. I did it for public service. I want to help. I feel I can help the country. I have no interest in making money from it. Any ideas about how I'm going to somehow.... It's foreign to me. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I am following every single rule. I want to be way far from the chalk line, if you will. Again, you can see it with the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner. It's how I've lived my life. My objective here is that I want to restore the relationship. I want to get the two Michaels out and the Schellenberg situation sorted. That's what I want to try to achieve", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There are a number of other issues dealing with your involvement in China with the McKinsey group, and some of your statements about being bullish on China, on the belt and road project, which some have suggested is contrary to Canada's interests in the Asia-Pacific region, and the notable comment about drinking the Kool-Aid about China and President Xi. Do you have any thoughts on that now that are different from what you expressed so effusively to the Council on Foreign Relations and others?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes. I would say a couple of things. One is that I'm very bullish on the growth of China. I think it's going to continue to move the urbanization, as I went through it.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Many of the comments I made were pre-2016, and I think things have changed. The world changes in where it is. If you asked me what I felt about China in 2003, or about what I wrote about or said in 2009, or what I thought about Poland and different.... Do you know what I mean? I do have views that I express. I don't hold them to the end of time. As I said in my opening remarks, again, I am amazed by the growth of where China is. I'm very concerned right now with the crackdown on dissent and where things are. I've been quite direct with government about saying that and how I feel.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I don't want to give you the sense that there's an inherent bias that everything's rosy and great, because that's not how?, \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Tell me, Ambassador?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You have 30 seconds, Jack", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You mentioned human rights. I want to raise another issue, which is about McKinsey having a seminar very close to the internment camp for Uighurs. Were you sensitive about human rights in that situation, or were you aware of it?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On that situation, I think Kevin Sneader, the managing partner, has come out to apologize on that side. They had no awareness at all on the McKinsey side that there was anything going on with the detention camps. If they had, they wouldn't have done it. So there's an apology for that having happened, and it wouldn't happen again. I would say that. That's how I view it. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It doesn't take me away from my role as ambassador for Canada to raise direct concerns on that issue with the Chinese government", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Ambassador', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Mr. Harris.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We'll now go to the second round. Members have five minutes each.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Genuis", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Barton, to pick up on what you just said to Mr. Harris, you suggested that McKinsey wasn't aware of the detention camps at the time when the corporate retreat in Kashgar happened. Is that what you said?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I did", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Okay. I ask because these mass detention camps were denounced by a UN committee a week before the retreat happened. Did McKinsey just miss the news item, or...?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, if you'd like to talk about my background with McKinsey, I'm very happy to keep going. I'm not sure if that's what we want to do in the committee, but I'm very happy to go?, \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I control the five minutes. I think this is very important for the public interest, sir, because you're telling me you're not aware of a lot of things?or weren't aware of a lot of things?that are pretty fundamental. You said that McKinsey had this corporate retreat completely unaware that there were concentration camps four miles away", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, what I'm saying is that I'm not trying to absolve myself or anything. I'm happy to...I'm saying that McKinsey apologized for that having been done; it is my understanding that they were not aware that was the case. That's what I'm saying.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Again, back to some of the earlier comments you made about the situations like the company in the South China Sea, you were saying that McKinsey is working with them and then implying that McKinsey is working on building things, and it's just completely false. All I was saying?, \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Sir, with respect, what I said?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Order. I just ask members to show respect and make sure that we have a chance to hear from each person, because we have interpreters, of course, and they need to have time to interpret", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, I think the process is that I control the time, but I'll ask a question and, Mr. Barton, I'd like to hear your response to it. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You have said there was not an awareness of what was happening in these camps by McKinsey, yet there were news items. There were UN reports beforehand. You've said that you're not aware of Canada's policy in the South China Sea. My charge was never that McKinsey was physically building these installations in the South China Sea; it's that McKinsey was advising the companies and working with companies under World Bank sanctions that were in fact doing this. You've said that you're not responsible because it's a big company and so forth, but you set the policy direction. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Are you comfortable that all these things were happening under policy direction you set? Are these the things you consider consistent with your personal values?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, there's a lot to unpack in that. I'll try to answer it. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0One, as I said, on the situation with the retreat and the Uighur detentions, I'm saying that McKinsey has said they were not aware of the case.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As it relates to the South China Sea, as I said, I'm going to follow what the government policy is. We basically believe that we should follow what arbitration says in what they want to do. For any more detail on that, I'm going to have to get advice for what it is, but we believe in what international arbitration says.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm not trying to skirt the issues. I'm just trying to say that on McKinsey's side, I happy to go into that as much as you want. I just would be careful about conflating what McKinsey was doing versus what was actually happening", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Sir, I really look forward to seeing that complete list of companies?state-owned companies?that you advised. I hope you'll be able to submit those to the committee. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You said at the beginning of your testimony that you commend what China is doing to try to contain the coronavirus. Part of what China is doing to contain the coronavirus is that when somebody dies of this virus their body is taken away from the families and they're not allowed burial. They're banning Christian funerals.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Are you aware of the human rights abuses that are happening in the context of this so-called effort to contain the coronavirus? Do you want to qualify your initial remarks at all that you commend what China is doing in this respect?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You have 30 seconds", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What's going on in China right now with this coronavirus is unbelievable, and I don't think we should underestimate the scale of what's happening and how the infections occur. I've not heard anything that would suggest to me that they're doing this for religious purposes. They're terrified of the spread of where this is, and I think the scale of what's going on is like Berlin in 1948 with the airlifts and getting food in there and so forth. It's an unbelievably high-scale operation. That's what I'm commending them for.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 To lock down a city of 11 million people to try to protect all of us from not getting infected, I think, is a very worthy thing, and I commend them for that", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Genuis.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Yip', " \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip (Scarborough?Agincourt, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Ambassador Barton, for coming such a long way to join us today. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Part of our mandate in this committee is to review consular relations. Can you provide an update on evacuation efforts happening in Wuhan and what other countries are doing to evacuate their citizens?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 As I mentioned, we have 373 Canadians who have said they want help. We have 211 on the flight manifest for this plane, which hopefully will leave tomorrow around noon. That leaves a gap. What we're looking at to help in closing that gap from 373 to 211 is talking with the British and the Americans, because they have room on planes and they're right there. I think the minister talked about that this afternoon. That would be the fastest way, but there are all sorts of logistical challenges, so we're looking at that carefully. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0At the same time, we're looking at the second plane coming in. We have the plane; it's ready. We just don't want to send an A380 to pick up five people. That's how we're working it.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0One of the things that has been quite important in this is the registering of Canadians. I think there were only 91 people who were registered as Canadians on January 10 in Hubei province. As the crisis has emerged, we're now up at 500. We're also asking, what are the other areas in China where we have Canadians who are registering and where is the infection moving? To use that tired expression about where the puck is going, we're trying to figure out where that is ahead of time so that we know what's happening.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Those are some of the things, but the challenge, too, is the logistics on the ground. I spoke to someone this morning, a family that had travelled 250 kilometres to get to the airport, and when they got into the airport there was no more water in the vending machines, and it was cold. We can't get our people into the airport because of the security. Therefore, it's working out those details, and we need to be as responsive as we can.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I don't know if that gives you enough", " \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Are you in discussions with the Chinese government to allow you more access for the consular officials on the ground, in the example you just mentioned about the water and trying to get in, and so forth? , \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0They're being very helpful. When we raise the issue, they'll say, ?Okay, where are they?? They're trying to help themselves as they go through it. We've really beefed up the team that's on the ground, because they're very nervous about the number of people coming in. We've added a second team to go in. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0They're being very open on it, but they have very strict controls. It's 10 to 20 stops that people have to go through to get to the airport. We have to help get these people through, so we have very direct communication with them and we've found them to be quite helpful", " \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There is enough staff on the ground in Wuhan, but what about if there should be other affected areas?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's why, again, we actually haven't reduced our embassy staff as much as other countries have, such as Australia or the U.K", " because we basically want to have the resources to be able to deal with that. As long as people are not afraid?and they're not?we would like to have those resources. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We're also reallocating people. We've moved people from immigration, where there's not a lot of activity. There are not a lot of tourists flying. We've moved them?, \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm sorry, but I'm going to cut you off so I can ask my next question.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0China does not recognize dual citizenship. We know there are Canadians who enter China with a Chinese passport, and now they are not allowed to leave Wuhan. What is being done to help these Canadian citizens? Also, what is being done to help Canadian permanent residents?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Before you go on, Ambassador, I want to ask all members to try to make sure that when a question is asked, the witness has an opportunity to answer. Of course, I think there was, but I just want to point that out.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ambassador", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Sure. I'll reply quickly.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0China has quite strict rules about consular services and how those work with permanent residents, and so forth. They do that with all countries. What we don't want to do, and they've agreed with this, is break up families. They're being helpful on that. I've had a number of conversation. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm a pipsqueak in it, because the team is doing it, but just to check in, where you have a husband who is a Canadian citizen, you have a permanent resident, and then you have a one-year-old who is being breast-fed. They're all going. They normally wouldn't, but they want to keep the families together. However, they have a policy that we have to deal with. We're trying to push it in other cases", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you, Ms. Yip.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Now we have Mr. Albas', " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas (Central Okanagan?Similkameen?Nicola, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Ambassador. I appreciate your service. Obviously, with service comes scrutiny by the public, including their officials, so I appreciate your being here.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Have you ever met with Huawei officials in your capacity as Canada's ambassador to China?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I have", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Would you mind putting on the record whom you met with from Huawei and where you met them and roughly when?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I'm not sure what the privacy rules are, but I have had outreach from some of the senior vice-presidents to talk about information that relates to the consular cases", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Privacy Act pertains to Canadian citizens', " \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's right", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0So did you meet with these officials in China?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, I did. , \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay, and were they Chinese officials from Huawei or were they Canadian ones?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0One was Canadian and one was Chinese', " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 What was the nature of your conversations?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Again, I'm a rookie at what's private or not in this sort of thing, but they were conversations about the relationship between Canada and China, what was happening with the Meng situation and so forth. They were giving their views about the situation and what was happening. I'm open to hearing ideas and views from many different people in the system. It wasn't a negotiation or anything like that. It was just, 'Here's our view of what's happening.', \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Did you raise the illegal detention of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Absolutely. I always do that when I have the chance, and I did", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In this case, did any commitments by those officials come from that?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Again, it's unclear to me what influence the company has in China, and it's not for me to figure out the detail of that. What I expressed to them was that while they might be very upset and concerned because Madam Meng had been arrested, we are very upset and concerned because Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig have been arrested, and we've had the death sentence put on Robert Schellenberg.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That was the nature of the discussion", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Did the Huawei officials ever suggest a so-called prisoner exchange, as had been suggested by Eddie Goldenberg and plied by other senior officials such as John Manley and Jean Chr?tien?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0They did not to me', " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Again, I think it's important for us to be asking, because, as you said, the relationship is broken, and you talked about wires and linkages, and I think that obviously includes talking to the business community among others.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Sir, you mentioned earlier your lack of knowledge of the position on the South China Sea. Obviously, that's a very important geopolitical issue. It's important to trade. It's important to Canada. I'm from British Columbia, so I know that having some certainty in those areas is very important.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On July 12, 2016, at the time the Minister of Global Affairs, St?phane Dion, said he welcomed the tribunal ruling on the Convention of the Law of the Sea by a UN body, and in it he said, ?Canada therefore stands ready to contribute to initiatives that build confidence and help restore trust in the region.?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ambassador, how can you stand ready for initiatives that build confidence and help restore trust if you don't know the government's position on the South China Sea?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As I mentioned on the South China Sea, just to clarify, we respect and would respect international arbitration rulings on what has happened in that case, and the international ruling is that there is a concern. ASEAN has also raised issues, and we've supported that. I do have a view on that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 In general, the Canadian government respects international arbitration and policies, but we're careful about what we talk about on the maritime side. On the South China Sea, I very much worry about trade being able to flow through places. We care a lot about that. I know we do a lot in the Taiwan Strait, for example. The navy goes through there as a matter of course, so open sea routes are important", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Albas.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Oliphant', " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant (Don Valley West, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Ambassador Barton, for being with us.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think it's important to note that our committee is doing some important work. Our work is meant to look at this complex, important relationship we have with China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You've been invited here to help us. I think that some members who are subbing on the committee seem to think this is an American-style confirmation hearing. This is not. I want to make sure that people watching this recognize that your appointment has followed due process. Everything about this appointment has been for the best interests of Canada. I personally want to thank you for your public service and doing this.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This is not about you?, \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have a point of order, Mr. Chair", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On a point of order, Mr. Genuis', " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, I think you'd find that it's out of order for the member to imply that in a free society tough questions to public officials are out of order. It is important that, in Canada, we are able to ask challenging questions to government appointees", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Genuis, this is a matter of debate.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Oliphant', " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I didn't name any names. I am saying this is not about you; this is about Canada's relationship with China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm no expert on China. On my trips to China, however, if I had a dime for every time Norman Bethune's name was mentioned, I would be wealthy. It is a constant thing. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On my most recent trip to China, I thought that it would help the Chinese understand the importance of the relationship. What I heard was a different thing from Chinese officials, which was that they expected we would then understand them better. That becomes a complex thing. We were talking like this: they saw an extradition process as being one thing; we saw arbitrary detention as something else. We weren't speaking the same language.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Can you tell us how you're trying to pull those two vectors together to get us on a common language?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Sure, because I do think there are, as I said, from the history and the culture, different perspectives and views on the world. I think that what we first tried to do was move away from what I'd call the ?speech-reading? on both sides, which literally was, first, ?You are lapdogs of the U.S. You've done this and that and the other?, and why they were so upset with that. We were saying, ?We're following the rule of law in what we did. We have an extradition treaty, and this is how it works.? You did see that, but part of it was because there was no discussion. It was just talking at each other and there was no time for discussion. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What I find to be helpful?again, we have to get results, otherwise this is activity with no impact?is to unpack it a bit and say, ?Do you know what? We actually have this long-standing relationship. Our people like each other.? Do you know what I mean? There's, ?Let's go back to what we like about each other. Let's not forget that. Let's talk a bit about why that is the case. What are some of the things we did for each other in the past?? Just build trust and open the ears on both sides on where it is.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There are going to be differences. We're never going to be singing from the same hymn book on this, but we can start to find some common areas that we can work on. We have a lot of things to work on and a common agenda out there. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When we think about this challenge we have, let's not lose the forest for the trees. I don't know if I'm answering your question properly, but that's...", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Are you hopeful?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I am hopeful', " \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm hopeful because, just by definition I'm an optimistic person, so you have to take that, but I actually believe there are small steps.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We did not have any formal communications. A lot of it was informal. We now have very good formal relations. We have real discussions where we can argue and debate, and say, ?Let's try to figure this out and understand where things are.? There's a momentum. I think they want to have this sorted and we want to have this sorted. I feel like there's a broader discussion. There are small steps.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Again, I'd go back to the meat and the pork. I had nothing to do with that. The Prime Minister was very nice to say it, but part of it is that we couldn't even get to resolve the issue because we couldn't communicate or talk. Now that we can communicate we could actually resolve the issue.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0These things start to open up other opportunities, and those are signals or green shoots. Sorry, I see lots of green shoots", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What would give you hope?, \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Perfect. Thank you', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Oliphant. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm now going to give two and a half minutes to Monsieur Bergeron and then to Mr. Harris. After that, if members agree, we'll take a five-minute health break, if that's all right. Members can let me know their views on that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Bergeron. , \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have two and a half minutes. Is that right, Mr.\xa0Chair? I can see that I do.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I hate to go back to questions that I've already asked, primarily because I'm wasting precious minutes, and also because I feel as though I'm putting you on the hot seat, which isn't my intention at all.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I know that you were appointed after Meng Wanzhou's arrest. That's obvious to everyone. To your knowledge, was the embassy contacted? Was the advice of specialists in relations with China sought when the International Assistance Group had to make a decision regarding Meng Wanzhou's pre-trial custody?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, again, I wasn't there, so I don't know, but my sense from the way it works with Justice is that they just decide. They make their decision; it's a case that comes through. My sense of it was that there was not any sort of broader discussion of it", " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You're therefore unable to assess the extent to which the precedent of the Garratt couple in 2014 could have been taken into account as a warning of what was to come", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Again, my sense is that Justice has quite a strict process?that they deal with all of these. I don't know how they looked at it. I don't think that it was more broadly discussed", " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs have repeatedly told us that they're seeking the support of a number of countries to lobby on behalf of detained Canadians.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have two questions about this.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First, is this really an effective way to put pressure on the Chinese authorities or, on the contrary, will this make the Chinese authorities more firm in their position?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Second, doesn't the new Chinese silk road initiative undermine, so to speak, Canada's efforts on the international stage?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Bergeron, your two and a half minutes are up. However, I'll let Mr.\xa0Barton briefly respond", " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You're too kind, Mr.\xa0Chair", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I didn't take good enough notes on your first question. I'm sorry about this. I'm happy to go over if you want. , \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Doesn't the strategy of seeking international support run the risk of making the Chinese more firm in their position?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Quickly, I think it's a good thing to do, but it's not sufficient. It's sort of like necessary but not sufficient. I don't think it's going to unlock it, but it's a good thing to do.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 On the silk road or the belt and road initiative, as I think we say from a government point of view, there are many good aspects of it in the sense of the trade opening, but there are many concerning aspects about the transparency and the debt that's in the system. It's not black or white in where it is, and that's I think the view we have on it. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Bergeron.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Harris", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you. I'll ask a quick question that's similar to Monsieur Bergeron's.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 You were very bullish, of course, as you say, on China, but also on the one belt, one road blueprint. We've gone into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or the CPTPP, with other countries specifically to attempt to strengthen economic ties and not to be dominated by China. Do you think your work and enthusiasm for the Chinese project runs counter to that strategy and does that cause problems for you?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Again, I am the ambassador for Canada, so I'm going to be pursuing what the government is saying. My understanding of what the government is saying is that we want to be very careful about certain aspects of the belt and road initiative, again, on its transparency and debt and whether or not it beholdens some of the people involved in it. On the other hand, there are aspects of it that are positive in opening up trade, which benefits Canadian companies that are actually on that. , \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you. Fair enough.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have one last question. It has to do with the question at the beginning?the point of order?with regard to the 14 countries that support Canada and the others who say they do but won't say it loudly enough for others to hear. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is there any comprehensive strategic plan for working with them? We've heard nothing about a task force with other countries?as we have seen in the Iranian situation?and special efforts in the PMO, for example, to work with all of these people in a systematic way. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is something like that going on, and would it help?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There is. With the 14 countries, there are conversations. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0One of the first things I did when I got to Beijing was to thank the ambassadors of those countries for doing that and continuing it. That continues in where it is, but as I mentioned to the chair in response to a previous question, it's a good thing to do but it's not going to unlock.... We have to do other things in addition. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, it continues, but we also have to look at other means", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It doesn't really help is what you're saying", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It does. It definitely does. What we don't want to do is to have this happen again or to happen to another country, so it's in other countries' interests to say they don't.... It may be Canada now, but who's next? There is an interest. The minister has even talked about the notion of a protocol that would be put in place that countries would agree to.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It definitely is something that we are continuing to move on, but we have to think about other things in addition", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Ambassador', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Harris.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Colleagues, we're going to add the five minutes onto the end of the meeting, but we'll suspend for now.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ambassador, I understand that when we come back you'd like to correct something from earlier on, and I'll give you an opportunity to do that. , \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Sure", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We'll add that as well, if you don't mind, to the time for the meeting. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The meeting is suspended.\xa0\xa0(1850)\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\xa0(1900)\xa0\xa0\n\n, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I'm calling the meeting back to order.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I understand you don't have a statement, Mr. Ambassador.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We're still on five minutes. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Alleslev", " \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev (Aurora?Oak Ridges?Richmond Hill, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much for being here, Ambassador.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's very important that we understand more about where we need to be going. Many of the things you said are about deepening and broadening the relationship with China, yet at the same time promoting and defending Canada's interests. I wonder if you could speak to that in terms of the vulnerability that we face by doing more business with China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Can you tell us what you're doing to protect us from that vulnerability?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Again, I very much believe in this notion that we engage, but that we also defend our interests and where we need to do both.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think we've been working with industry on that side. If you think about canola, it would be the classic vulnerability. With such a significant portion of our canola exports going there, when that is hit it is a big vulnerability. I think we're saying, let's make sure we have diversification and that we're not putting too many eggs in one basket, and also just working with the industry to make sure we think about how that works", " \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0But there is the rule of law. It feels to Canadians that China is not respecting the rule of law, and that it shouldn't be able to put this punishing prohibition on our exports. Diversifying will just mean China can hold us hostage on more fronts at the same time rather than just one, but it still has a material impact, particularly if we broaden..", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What I meant was that it's not broadening within China; it's broadening in Asia. We aren't just putting all our eggs in one basket, first of all, in China. It's an important market. There's a very big market in Asia too, so let's make sure we do that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Second, I think we have to use the rule of law. On canola, where I've been quite involved with industry and the government has been involved, we went to the WTO. That has now led to discussions. So there was a hard...and then there was a discussion.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The important thing I think is that we do it with industry, that we're working together on that", " \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0How would you characterize the progress?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think the progress is quite good, but let's see the result. We're in discussions. We were not having any discussions before and we are now. This has involved not only the federal government, but provincial government people as well, again with the industry. So, there's a dialogue. There was a refusal to have a discussion before, so we're getting into that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0China also needs some of these products we're talking about, so it's moving in the right direction, but we have to get the result", " \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Now, clearly, we're seeing that there isn't necessarily the same kind of separation between corporations and government in the People's Republic of China as we would have in North America. With mandated laws in China that say that corporations have to provide governments with that information, how do we mitigate that and protect and defend Canadian interests when doing business with these countries?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think that when Canadian companies are doing business with Chinese companies, the trade commissioner's officers are very good at explaining the requirements, what type of joint venture agreement you should have and being very open about how that works. I also think we need to differentiate between state-owned companies and the private sector. There's a lot of noise about what's happening where. We need to spend time focused on each company and understand the governance of that company", " \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0But are there not a number of increasingly private corporations that have party officials on their boards? That's an increasing trend in China?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There are reports of that happening. That's why I think it is most important to look at each company individually, just as we would do in other places. You can understand very clearly what's happening. It's not intransparent", " \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It feels to Canadians as if it's not very transparent. Could you advise us on why we should believe it is transparent?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I think this is the difference between being in the country and being outside the country. I think it's important to understand who the individuals are and what their relationships are. You can get a lot of information that way, and you can find out from other Chinese business leaders as well how they think about it. Look at the results of joint ventures. A lot of other businesses around the world are interacting with companies and some don't interact with others; that's very clear when you're there", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you, Ms. Alleslev.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I'll now give the floor to Mr.\xa0Dubourg, who will share his time with Ms.\xa0Yip", " \n\xa0\nMr. Emmanuel Dubourg (Bourassa, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes. Thank you, Mr.\xa0Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Your Excellency, I want to thank you for joining us.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First, I want to join my colleagues from the Bloc Qu?b?cois and the NDP in saying that your work on the ground under the current circumstances is important to us. We must give our regards to the three Canadians detained over there. I know that we've been told that there may be 123\xa0Canadians detained in Hong Kong or China, but these three cases are a little more problematic.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to ask you a few questions. I looked through your CV and I can see that your background is exemplary. I want to congratulate you on that. I can also see that you're very familiar with the situation on the ground over there.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When you were contacted following Mr.\xa0McCallum's departure, what was your reaction? Can you clearly show us that, based on your experience and expertise, you're the right person for this role, even though we said earlier that, since your arrival, we've really seen the tension drop? Tell us about the experience that you have to help Canada in this difficult situation", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thanks, again, for the messages to our detainees. That will be very well received by them next week.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I hope I'm understanding correctly. I was asked to take this role before, and I didn't want to do it. I didn't feel it fitted my timing. After I was asked again, I felt there was a very significant need. I think what I've tried to bring to it is my experience, as I have relationships from having lived in that country that have been built over time with people. They know that I know what they're like. They know I will tell truth to power. I don't back off on that. They know my track record. And it's broad. It's not just business. It's in government, the social sector and universities. Probably my closest linkages are through the university system. What I've tried to do is to bring those relationships to bear, to the extent I can. There are other Canadians who also have very good relationships in China that we need to harness. That's from the academic side, the NGO side and from the business side. Our pension funds, for example, are very influential in where it is. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0So, it was to try to assemble a team, if you will, and then have a plan. I think it's the total commitment. My objective is to restore the relationship, but within those three parameters. I have been very clear all the way through, and I'm focused. I talked with anyone I possibly could, mainly informally at first because it was difficult to have formal conversations. I would meet people and say, ?Oh, I happened to see you in the restaurant?. That's interesting, that type of discussion, in then getting to a formal basis. Again, the team we have in Beijing is very good. They have those relationships, too. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's what we've tried to do to build the channels to have the discussions", " \n\xa0\nMr. Emmanuel Dubourg: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In your introduction, you said that you were asked to restore that relationship and to bring the two Michaels back to Canada. You also talked about human rights. However, you did say that Canada must understand China and China must understand Canada. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Granted, it's not in your mandate, but what role are you going to play in that area? What common ground will you build on to make this mutual understanding real?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think on the Chinese side there's a broad understanding that we're a resource-based country, a country that's been very helpful. But it's about making sure they understand the depth and breadth of who we are and our capabilities, I think, are areas where that's the case. And why do we believe in human rights the way we do? It's one thing to say it, but why is that the case? What's our history on that front? It's more the whys of how this works. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There are some Canadian study centres in a number of the universities. I think, by the way, we need to fund them more because we need to have more Chinese academics writing about Canada, not Canadians writing about Canada in China, and there's an appetite for it. But we support it. So those are the stories we need to get across", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you, Monsieur Dubourg.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Over to Mr. Albas', " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ambassador, earlier in my intervention I asked you about your meetings with Huawei officials, including the dates, locations, and the identity of the people you met with. I'd like you to submit that to the committee. Perhaps you could do it by February 14. That would be an acceptable time. It's important for Parliament to receive this information. I'd appreciate your co-operation", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, I'm happy to be helpful on that one. I want to be prudent in terms of the specific discussions I had, so I'm going to get some advice, if I can, from GAC. I'm personally comfortable?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I certainly appreciate that. Parliamentary committees do have extensive powers, but I do appreciate your being co-operative in the matter. Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'll pass it to Mr. Warkentin", " \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin (Grande Prairie?Mackenzie, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Ambassador, for being here. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I do want to drill down a little bit in terms of lessons learned. You did say that when being advised by other countries, partners and allies, one of the important lessons to be learned is not to be bullied. Frankly, Canadians feel like we're being bullied right now. We have the arbitrary detention of Canadian citizens. We have what seems to be arbitrary and nonsensical cutting out of our agricultural exports. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You mentioned pork. It's interesting that you believe that their allowing Canadian pork back into China was a good sign. Why did you say that?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, as I said, I did hear from many different embassies and countries, first of all, on the notion of not being bullied, and I think that's about standing up. That's why the Prime Minister is not interested in doing prisoner swaps on that. It's about being clear; we have a system, and people say, ?Stay, and you do do that?. And you move through it.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On agriculture, to your question?, \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I wasn't clear on my question, I don't think. You said that it was a good sign. Most Canadians believe that it was an arbitrary decision for the Chinese simply to shut it out. It was for ulterior reasons that they were shutting out Canadian pork. The Chinese made the case that they believe that it was because of a document issue. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Do you believe that it was done, that the ban was lifted because of reconciliation of the documents, or do you believe it was done because they decided to show some indication of good will?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, this is an area that I've delved into quite deeply with the industry, the Canadian Meat Council.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The view is that a mistake was made. It was not seen as an arbitrary shift. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If I might just finish, the issue was then being able to try to get that so that it stopped. Because there were no discussions, we then couldn't figure out how to resolve it. As the discussions moved on, we were able to resolve it, and it's in China's interest, but it was stuck. It was a mistake. It was stuck, and now I think, through very good efforts from the meat council and others in the industry, and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, and everyone, they were able to get it sorted. , \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We have a major issue, and it's an ongoing crisis with the canola exports. Where are we with that?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair?, \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Pardon me. Again, the vast majority of Canadians, especially Canadian farmers, believe this is arbitrary and has nothing to do with the canola, but is simply retaliation for a relationship gone sideways. , \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, the first thing I'd say is that anyone who knows me knows how passionate I am about the ag food industry, so I have a very strong personal interest in that. There's a very significant opportunity. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I do think it was a punishment, if you will. They stopped it. As I said, we've gone to the WTO. That has led to what I think are some constructive discussions, technical discussions that we're having, so it's moving forward. At the end of the day, the results matter, but there's momentum", " \n\xa0\nMr. Chris Warkentin: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Oh, yes, results do matter.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In terms of lessons learned, you said that we shouldn't be bullied. Now you've admitted that this is definitely one example of being bullied. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Obviously, you've talked about WTO challenges. Those are very lengthy and very costly, and we don't have time on our side when it comes to the exports in this industry. What other types of leverage do you believe that Canada has to try to break free from this punishing ban?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think, Mr. Chair, that the WTO is the vehicle that we have for going through it. What we have to say is that food security matters a lot to China, and if you think about the protein demands on the meat and the vegetable side, we are going to be a critical source of where that is. If Canadian farmers are nervous?and they are, even on the meat side?about committing, just in case something goes on, that supply is not going to come in. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What we're doing is saying is.... First of all, we didn't do something else to try to get the canola. We've gone to use the mechanisms that we have. Then we're saying, ?You need to be careful,? on the Chinese side, ?because we are a high-quality, safe food supplier.? What this does is make people very nervous about piling in behind it, and we're explaining that to them", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Warkentin.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Zann', " \n\xa0\nMs. Lenore Zann (Cumberland?Colchester, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you so much for being here. It's been extremely interesting listening to you and hearing your own perspective of what's going on in China. I'm very glad to hear that you are a big believer in the culture as well.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As somebody who has been involved with culture here in Canada, I really believe in cross-laterally talking with people, bringing in plays, ballets and things like this, so thank you for your efforts.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I do want to talk about a December 2019 editorial by the current and former presidents of the International Crisis Group. They said the following about their colleague, Mr. Kovrig:\n\n\n\nAlthough China has never spelled out the reasons for Michael's imprisonment, it is clear that he is merely a pawn in a larger geopolitical game.\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0At the same time, they cautioned against the adoption of ?a far more aggressive approach toward China? and noted: \n\n\n\n...Beijing has a critical role to play not only in its own Asian neighborhood but elsewhere as well, including in preventing, mitigating and resolving deadly conflict?across the globe from Central Asia to the Korean Peninsula, from Afghanistan to Venezuela, from Sudan to Zimbabwe.\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As ambassador, can you please explain to us why engagement is the best approach to managing bilateral and multilateral relations with China?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0A few quick things....\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm glad on the cultural side. I think we always underestimate that, and I can't tell you the number of people in the film industry, arts and music who are doing things. Those are, again, important for the relationship.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think, again, precisely because China is playing a bigger role in the world, we need to engage with them in areas. If you think about Africa, if you think about peacekeeping, or if you think about disaster relief, there is a lot of interest that the Red Cross Society of China has with the Canadian Red Cross because of our capabilities. They're impressed with how we do disaster relief.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As we have, unfortunately, more disasters in the world, when looking at how countries co-operate?they have a lot of resources; we have a lot of capabilities?there are many areas where we can do things together.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Even with this coronavirus and pandemics, we, as a country, have a real depth in understanding how those work, and I think there are opportunities to collaborate. That is what I think I would say", " \n\xa0\nMs. Lenore Zann: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I notice that the Chinese officials thanked Canada for the way we have reacted to the coronavirus, in that we have not reacted in the same way as the United States, for instance, or Australia. I believe that, again, shows this spirit of co-operation that is so important in this global world.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In a 2017 speech to Universities Canada, you described three global shifts that are under way right now: an economic power shift from the west to primarily Asia, but also to Africa, primarily Nigeria; the technical revolution, for instance computing power, connectedness, big data and artificial intelligence; and the need for a new societal deal that would address such economic forces as automation, which we all know is going to be a big thing in the future.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Would you say still that the economic power is continuing to shift from western countries to those in Asia? What key forces are driving China's economic rise, and are those forces sustainable?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I very much believe in that economic power shift. As I said, we're 15 years in, and we have a long period to go. It's driven by a combination of population, the young population of a huge middle class, of well over 1.5 billion new middle class coming into the system. In a sense, it's a re-rise of this part of the world, and it's driven by urbanization?China has a long way to go on urbanization?and a shift in the economy to the service sector.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's happening in other parts. It's happening in Vietnam, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and as I mentioned, Nigeria and East Africa. These represent opportunities for Canada, and we have a good reputation because of our standards and how we do human rights, how we follow the law. We're highly respected. We just need to get out there", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You have 15 seconds for a final comment', ' \n\xa0\nMs. Lenore Zann: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There is one thing I just want to note. You did note the aging population, and that is becoming a problem in China, just as it is in Japan and in Nova Scotia.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0How does that play into this economic thrust?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 In three or four words, please, Ambassador', " \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The world is aging. We're all going to have to deal with this. We can learn from each other", ' \n\xa0\nMs. Lenore Zann: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Ms. Zann.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Before we continue, I want to say that we started the meeting at 5:35\xa0p.m', " and that we took a 10-minute break. We'll keep going until 7:45\xa0p.m.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Bergeron, you have two and a half minutes", " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You're too generous, Mr.\xa0Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When the Prime Minister publicly insisted that he expected the United\xa0States to intervene to secure the release of Michael\xa0Spavor and Michael\xa0Kovrig, a Chinese foreign affairs official immediately stepped in and said not to try to put pressure on China through a third party. However, the Department of Foreign Affairs maintains, as you did a few moments ago, that it's a good strategy to seek support in other countries.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As long as we know that China is taking offence at this type of tactic, how can we be sure that it's a good strategy to change the situation for the better?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, this is a very interesting question.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think we do have a triangle here with China, Canada and the United States. We know there are lots of trade tensions going on between China and the U.S. There are lots of different views within the U.S. administration as to whether or not it is a trade deal, or.... There are a lot of issues going on, and we're caught up in it because we're an ally of the United States and we also want to trade and do things with China. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My view is that we have to recognize a reality that there are those dimensions happening together that we have to factor in. I think we will talk to the United States about this and we have to be clear about it. What China reacts to most negatively is if it's a finger-wagging with nothing else, which is not that helpful, right? That's their sense of it, right?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I think what we have to say again as we're thinking about this whole situation is that there are three parties involved. The Prime Minister is being quite vocal with the President in saying, ?We've followed the rule of law on this extradition, so what are you doing on this side?? It's not saying, ?Do X, Y, Z?. It's saying, ?What are you doing about it?? I think that's a healthy thing", " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As I was saying, we'll have a chance to take another look at?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm sorry, Mr.\xa0Bergeron, but your time is up", ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I relied on you, Mr.\xa0Chair', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm sorry. It's my fault", ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You should acknowledge that a mistake occurred and let me continue', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ha, ha! Nice try, Mr.\xa0Bergeron.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Harris, you have the floor', " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 These times are not long enough to have a full discussion. Hopefully, we can get you to come back.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We're obviously interested here in making sure that everything is being done that can be done with respect to the detainees. Also, we're concerned about the overall relationship and the levers that we aren't using that could be used. Have you discovered any new ones since you've become ambassador? , \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, I'm interested in ideas from the committee, by the way, because I think we have to be creative while recognizing that we have a rule of law and not being bullied. I think there's room for creativity.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As I said, international pressure is a good part of it, and we need to keep that up for the long term. In terms of discussions with China, I think we need to look at it and say that there's so much more we can do together, so why is this getting in our way? We need to frame that up. It's one thing to say it, but what does that look like? It's working with the United States.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I think there are areas, but we're going to have to have some creativity within the system that we are in. That's where, when you start discussing things with people, I think ideas can come up. , \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to go back to the question of bullying as a tactic, or as a fact of life, perhaps, in some international relationships. We've seen it with the American administration in some cases. I won't go into detail.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What disturbs me is that we're told there are 14 countries that are on our side and are willing to say so, but there is an unknown number of countries, perhaps a large number, that aren't. They're not willing to say so, obviously out of some sort of fear of repercussions, retaliation or some sort of bullying. I find that worrisome, as a citizen of the world. There are a lot of countries in the world; I'd like to see the list to see how many are there but not really there.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What do we do about that? Is there something that tells us what we need to do?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It's a very good point. One thing I was surprised about is that, well, this is an important area in which to do things, but I also feel a bit like we're alone in the world. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The good news is that there are 14 countries that have come out. There are other countries that, not for bullying reasons, but it's just their culture and approach, don't say anything about anyone. We can push them and drive them, but this isn't to do with China. They don't talk about the United States. It's just the way they are.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0All I'm saying is, as someone coming into this thought, this would be an obvious area. It was surprising to me, too.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I do think there are things we can do on that, because in a world that's changing so quickly, we have to think about working together. The whole of foundations are changing, the multilateral foundation, so I think we should invest in that because there are areas for co-operation. However, I too have been surprised at a number of places that are not interested in it, and interestingly, not because of bullying but it's just not what they want to do", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Harris.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Colleagues, as I indicated, we can go until 7:45. I understand that Mr. Manly would like to ask for agreement that he be permitted to ask a question.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Manly, do you want to make your request?, \n\xa0\nMr. Paul Manly (Nanaimo?Ladysmith, GP): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes. If the committee agrees, I would like to take a short opportunity to say something and ask a question', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is it agreed?, \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, I have no objection, but I have a question. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think the ambassador did say that he had some flexibility with the time. In light of Mr. Manly's desire and that of some others, could we possibly extend until 8 o'clock?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Apparently there isn't agreement to do that?, \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. Either way, it's fine", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0?but I guess there was agreement to let Mr. Manly ask a question, and then we will come back to the list. Is that all right?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Manly, I will let you go ahead', " \n\xa0\nMr. Paul Manly: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much for allowing me the opportunity to speak.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to echo some of the things I've heard from other members here. I'm not going to belabour these points, but in regard to your relationship to McKinsey and 22 of the 100 top state-owned corporations, your relationship to Teck Resources and the Chinese Investment Corporation and these conflicts of interest, I just want to put those concerns on the record.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0However, my question is related to this position we're in between the United States and China with Huawei and 5G and how you see this unfolding, how we're going to manoeuver through this situation with the Five Eyes and the demands by the Americans that we not take on Huawei Technologies to implement 5G. , \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Right. The 5G question is clearly a critical one. There are a lot of security issues that are going to be dealt with in that. I'm not part of that conversation. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We have people in the government who are looking at that file and moving it through. I think it's an important decision that's going to be made. Again, I'm not party to those discussions", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Manly.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Genuis, please. You have five minutes', " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Your Excellency, could you share a little about your engagement on the Celil case?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On the what?, \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Celil case. That's the name of a Canadian detained in China", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Oh, sorry, yes. He has been in detention for about 15 years', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes', " \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I've looked into that case. I call him Huseyin. Basically, because Huseyin is not a Canadian citizenship holder, we aren't able to get access to him on a consular services side. We've tried, because he's someone I would like to see. I know it has been a long-standing file, but?, \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Celil actually is a Canadian citizen.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My next question is, does the Government of Canada support calls for universal suffrage in Hong Kong?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There are two things I would say on that. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Again, on the case of Huseyin, we have tried everything we can and we do not have access on the consular services side. We've tried. If you have ideas of how to do it, I'm open to them.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On Hong Kong, we support the one country, two systems model. We believe people should have the right to be able to express their views. We're hopeful for a peaceful resolution of that, but we believe very much in the one country, two systems approach", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Do you support calls for universal suffrage in Hong Kong?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We support the one country, two systems model. There are very clear rules about what can be done and not done, and that's the approach we take", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, sir. I think your answer is clear.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You used the word ?friends?. You said that friends disagree with respect to the Chinese government. I'm curious. Principally, do you regard the Chinese government as a strategic friend, as a strategic competitor or foe or as something else?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As I mentioned, China is a very complex place. I think that to try to paint it as black or white is not appropriate. There are parts of what China does where we have a very strong common interest in what we want to do in advancing an agenda and there are parts of what China does that we fundamentally disagree with, but it's not black or white", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for providing your views on that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0During the introduction you spoke about cultural and philosophical differences. You talked about how we have to understand history and culture and that China's political differences, in your view, may be rooted in Confucian values of collectivism, unity and harmony. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My reading of the founding texts of Confucianism is they're very much at odds with the typical practices of the current Chinese government, and I would make this argument: It was the politics of the Marxist powers in China to try to destroy China's Confucian history. In places like Hong Kong and Taiwan that history was not destroyed. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Today Taiwan is a well functioning democracy, rooted very much in China's history and values, and Hong Kong is a place where there are strong calls for universal suffrage and democracy, which I would hope Canadians would support. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It seems to me that the political structures of China are not rooted predominantly in long-standing Confucian values, but in the political philosophy of Marxism and totalitarian control. I'd love to hear you defend your view on that. Are we maybe agreeing somewhat? What do you think about that thesis?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I don't think we're agreeing", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay', " \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My understanding of Chinese history?and as I said we all should spend time really understanding what's happening there?is that Confucianism is very much a part of the system and how it's working today. There are different manifestations of that in mainland China, not just in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and that's rooted, as I said, in the notion of harmony and the collective good as opposed to the individual. It's a view in that system. Many other dimensions, too, are worth looking at on that front. It doesn't mean that we have to agree, we just need to recognize? , \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have a quick follow-up question before time runs out.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Would you agree those values are completely compatible with freedom and democracy and with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as we've seen in places like Taiwan? , \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You packed a lot into that question. I'll try to answer it.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Some elements of collectivism and harmony are at odds with individual rights. They're different", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Genuis.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Fragiskatos', " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mr. Barton, we've met now tonight for two hours plus. You've answered a number of questions on a number of different topics. I see we're approaching the end of this meeting. Is there a key message you would like to communicate, not just to us tonight but to those Canadians who are following the issue of the Canada-Chinese relationship very closely and are concerned about it? Is there something you would like to put forward as your main message to them?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My main message is that China is a complex country and a society that represents very significant opportunities for us. A lot of our prosperity can benefit from being part of it, but there are also some things we don't agree with and don't like. Whatever your view is, we're going to have to engage with China. I'm of the view that we can make that work. But we are going to have to raise our game as a society and over time. I hope it's more of a long-term approach. Again, when I see how other countries are dealing with this, when they're struggling with a shift with China and the United States and so forth, we're seeing a more long-term consistent approach, which can again be by use of the accelerator and brake at the same time. I would hope we're not seeing this as a black and white model", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mr. Chair, I am going to be splitting my time with Ms. Yip.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As a last question, when you come to the conclusion of your appointment, whenever that might be, what will success look like, in your view?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Success, in my view, will defined as the following. I want Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig released and back in Canada, and I want the death sentence taken away from Robert Schellenberg. That is the fundamental point of what I would see', " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Ambassador.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'll share my time, as I said, with Ms. Yip", " \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There are 300,000 Canadians in Hong Kong. What are your thoughts on the Hong Kong protests and their impact on Canada?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Well, Mr. Chair, to your exact point, there are 300,000 Canadians there and we have to care about what happens to them. It's a high area of focus for us. I hope that people are listening to some of the messages that are being given by the protestors, and there's a broad range of messages. They relate also to income inequality and lack of opportunity and so forth. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I hope there can be a peaceful way for addressing those issues being raised. I think the elections that occurred recently were a manifestation of that. It was a process where messages were delivered. The Chinese government has not intervened or pushed through. I don't think that's what they wanted or expected, but they recognize that's where the people are. It's a delicate balance of hoping that ideas and people's expression can be put through, and that they can get to a peaceful place in it. I say so because the current course is harmful for everyone. , \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Do you feel that the coronavirus has muted some of these issues at all in Hong Kong?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think the coronavirus has changed the focus on a lot of things for the short term. The coronavirus is probably going to be here longer than we think, and I just don't believe the idea that we're going to be done with it in March. I'm not a virologist, so you should be careful whom you're listening to on that. I just think this is going to take longer.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That said, these issues are not going to go away in the world, and that's why I think we have to keep moving. Obviously, this is a big issue now, but we have to keep moving on all the other agenda items, too", " \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Some constituents have told me that they are scared and worried about loved ones in China, and also about the coronavirus spreading to Canada. What assurances can you give Canadians? Is there anything in your discussions with the Chinese government that could ease their minds or give them some peace of mind?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Well, first, if there's any country that I'd want to have to deal with a big crisis like that, it's them, in the sense of the scale. They don't want it to move out of the system at all. They're willing. When you see the lockdown that's going on in Hubei province and Wuhan, it's simply extraordinary. Even in other cities that are not affected.... In Beijing you could land a 747 on the Third Ring Road right now. It's just that people are focused and moving it. The effort China's making to contain this is extraordinary, and the World Health Organization has said so. You see it.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On the Canadian side, I'd also feel good. There was a lot of learning from the SARS issue in terms of how communications occurred, what we know among the provinces and the federal government. This whole field is an area of incredible strength for Canada. It's why China is actually asking for our help. It's not just the masks and the garments; they want virologists. They want access to our medical capability and advice on how this goes.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think government is being very transparent and open. The discussions about where things are going are very intense. We have, I think, five cases. Again, we also are going to extraordinary lengths, and we're being very evidence-based on this. It's very scientific and evidence-based, and that's key", ' \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Ms. Yip.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Now we'll go to Mr. Albas for three minutes, which will take us to the end of our time.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Albas", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Ambassador.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Just quickly on Huawei, public safety minister Bill Blair has suggested that security concerns will no longer be the only thing the government considers. To me, that means they will be considering things other than security, so that could be political. Would you be involved in any decision regarding that? Would you be advising Bill Blair or the government, in your capacity, as to what the political issues would be of denying Huawei access to our 5G?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 As I mentioned before, I am not involved. As I mentioned, on the technical side, I'm the wrong person. You need to have people who really understand the technology. It's not my area.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On the political?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0[Inaudible?Editor] officials", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think the Canadian government has the right people looking at 5G and the security issues who can actually address that. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On the political side, this is a decision that will have to be made. Whichever way it goes, there will be consequences, and I'll have to live with whatever the consequences are. I'm not involved in the? , \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think all of us will be living with the consequences, Ambassador.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You mentioned to the committee earlier that Canadian values are very important to you and that you would defend universal and inalienable human rights. Yet when MP Genuis asked you about universal suffrage in Hong Kong, you replied that the government believes in one country, two systems in response. How are the two consistent?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On this I would say that we have relationships with different countries in what we do. We as a government subscribe to the model of one country, two systems, so?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0[Inaudible?Editor] protest and the response by the authorities in Hong Kong to take democratic protesters expressing their will, or their wanting to maintain their system of two systems, and to be treated like that, you must admit there is a concern regarding human rights and violation of their rights. , \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Again, we follow the one country, two systems model. We are concerned. We want to enable people to be able to protest and to be able to share their views, and where they have...and I think we've been very open about that. We hope they come to some peaceful resolution on it, but it's one country, two systems. We want people to express their views and not have that stopped. We've said that", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You mentioned that coronavirus may be around longer than we think. You also mentioned that we have 650 people in greater China, which I would assume would also include Taiwan. Should Taiwan be included in international fora like the World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization? Do you believe that would be helpful?, \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Again, we follow the one China policy. I think on issues like health and pandemics and so forth that are affecting other people, we encourage the participation of all people who would be affected in it', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Mr. Albas.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Ambassador and Mr. Steil, for appearing today. Thank you for your work. I think we would all agree that we would like you to take our best wishes to Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor, whom we hope to see home soon, and also take our best wishes to Mr. Schellenberg. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Garnett Genuis: And Mr. Celil.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Chair: And Mr. Celil, Mr. Genuis adds. Indeed.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you so much', " \n\xa0\nMr. Dominic Barton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Colleagues, Global Affairs has informed me that Mr. Harris's issue is addressed in the information package that the clerk received earlier today. That will be distributed in the morning, so we can look forward to seeing that. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would remind colleagues that there is a subcommittee meeting tomorrow morning from 11 to 12, room 225A in West Block. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We've had I think four responses to a survey that was sent to members. I'd encourage members, if you have a moment tonight, to respond to the survey sent to you by the clerk. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, colleagues.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This meeting is adjourned. ]"]
["[\n\xa0\nThe Chair (Hon. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.)): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Colleagues, this meeting of the Special Committee on Canada-China Relations is called to order. Good morning. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This morning we'll have two panels.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The first part of the meeting will take place from 10:00\xa0a.m. to 11:30\xa0a.m", " and the second between 11:30\xa0a.m. and 1:00\xa0p.m.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We're starting off this morning with Charles Burton, senior fellow of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, who is with us here. We have Phil Calvert, senior fellow of the China institute of the University of Alberta, by video conference from Toronto. We also have Paul Evans, professor in the school of public policy and global affairs at the University of British Columbia, by video conference from Singapore, where it's 11 p.m", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris (St. John's East, NDP): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, I have a point of order. I was looking at the witness list and the number of witnesses in each of the one and a half hour periods. I've done some calculations based on our standing orders. It appears that if we are going to have three rounds of questioning, we need 64 minutes for this, leaving 26 minutes out of the 90 minutes.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm going to suggest that we confine the witnesses to a maximum of eight minutes each. I consulted with colleagues on this side. Those on the other side weren't here yet. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Otherwise, we're going to have a truncation at the end, and Mr. Bergeron and I would not get to participate in the third round", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I should tell you that the clerk advises me she has advised the witnesses that they have seven to 10 minutes.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Oliphant', " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant (Don Valley West, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I was just going to say that I don't disagree with Mr. Harris; however, I don't think it's fair to our witnesses, who have been given time to prepare their statements of 10 minutes. I would be happy to give up two minutes of Liberal time to the third and fourth party if they should need it. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I just don't think it's fair. I don't think it's good parliamentary procedure, and I think it's somewhat rude to our witnesses", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Albas', " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas (Central Okanagan?Similkameen?Nicola, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First of all, it's my understanding that all of the witnesses, whom I look forward to hearing from, have been told it's between seven and 10 minutes. Also, by supplying their briefs in advance.... \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The real value of the experts we have is that we can ask them the questions that may not be illustrated in their briefings. I would hope that we show some flexibility and ask them to either speed up a little or slightly edit their statements, knowing that the committee will be looking at these briefs in full", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The witnesses undoubtedly heard this conversation. I hope they'll do their utmost to keep it short.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We should get going so that we have a chance for as many committee questions and answers as possible.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Burton, we'll start with you", " \n\xa0\nDr. Charles Burton (Senior Fellow, Macdonald-Laurier Institute, As an Individual): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Good morning. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Chair. It's a great honour for me to be invited to give evidence to this committee. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have read all the evidence of the committee's meetings?numbers three, four and five?that were sent to me by the clerk, and all this evidence was given by senior Canadian government public servants explaining to the committee how they implement the Canadian government policy towards China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This morning, I'd like to highlight some factors in the Canada-China relationship that I was disappointed to see omitted in the earlier evidence, some assertions that I interpret differently and finally some recommendations that I have for the Government of Canada on how to more effectively further Canada's interests in our relations with China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First of all, as is the case in many Canadian families, Chinese, not English or French, is the language of my home. I bring this up because in my youth I read a lot of classical Chinese texts in the original. More than 40 years ago, I had the extraordinary privilege of being admitted into the history of ancient Chinese thought program in the department of philosophy at Fudan University in Shanghai.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Because of this, I was taken aback to read in the evidence given to the committee by a senior government official that the Chinese: \n\n\n\n...place an importance on the values of collectivism and harmony, owing to a Confucian heritage. Understanding the extent to which China values unity and the needs of society at large, rather than freedom of individual choice...we just have to understand that. That's where they're coming from. \n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Later, this earlier witness elaborated, ?Some elements of collectivism and harmony are at odds with individual rights. They're different.?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Let me point out that this assertion by our ambassador is consistent with the official propaganda of the Chinese Communist Party under General Secretary Xi Jinping. The Chinese Communist Party upholds its political legitimacy by claiming that China's traditional culture demands, in this modern age, a non-democratic single-party autocratic rule. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I could not disagree more with this interpretation, and I believe it is utterly refuted by the vibrant democracies based on respect for human rights and the rule of law existing today in Taiwan and South Korea.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The troubling question for me in terms of our policy towards China is that, if Canada accepts this idea that China values unity and the needs of society at large rather than freedom of individual choice, does that mean, for example, that Canada will stand idly by in the face of the horrendous and massive program of cultural genocide against the Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims in China who are confined, as we know, to the so-called re-education camps where they're not permitted to practise their religion at any time over their years of incarceration? The previous witness did not know how many Uighurs are incarcerated, but I can tell you that the U.S. State Department says three million, at least a million. The total population of Uighurs in China is about 10 million.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The other thing, with regard to a response we're not making, is that Canada has put the names of officials from Sudan, Russia, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia on our Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act's Magnitsky list, but in sharp contrast, no Chinese officials complicit in the persecution of Tibetans, Uighurs, Falun Gong, Chinese Christians, democracy activists and so on have been designated. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I believe this sends a strong signal to the PRC regime by omission, and the signal is that hostage diplomacy and the arbitrary imposition of trade sanctions against Canada is a policy that works. Our lack of any substantive response to this emboldens the Chinese regime to do more of this kind of thing in the future. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0A second point, the evidence given by our public servants in the previous meetings of this committee repeated over and over the formula that Canada's priority in China relations is ?the immediate release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, as well as clemency for Robert Schellenberg?.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0However, in response to questioning, one of the officials indicated there are two Canadians, Mr. Schellenberg and Mr. Fan Wei, whose charges on the death penalty are public and available. Why is this focus on Kovrig, Spavor and Schellenberg, three Canadians of non-Chinese origin, to the exclusion of Canadians Huseyin Celil and Fan Wei, who are not?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I judge that this would be deeply troubling to all Canadians formerly resident in the PRC prior to becoming Canadian citizens and joining our national family. \xa0\xa0(1010)\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Do we also thereby tacitly accept the Chinese government's claim that persons of Chinese origin in Canada have an obligation of residual loyalty to the Chinese state regardless of their Canadian citizenship? Is this why the serious problem of Chinese state harassment of persons of PRC origin in Canada, in gross violation of the protections of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, is essentially unaddressed by our government?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Let me conclude with recommendations that I have for the Government of Canada on how to much more effectively further Canada's interests in China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The PRC regime's flouting of the standards of international diplomacy is without question becoming more and more blatant as the years go by. Last week, the Czech government's president's office acknowledged the leak of a communication received by that office from the PRC embassy in Prague. In that communication, the PRC threatens that if the speaker of the Czech Parliament travels to Taiwan as planned, then three Czech companies with extensive business in China would be punished, including the famous Petrof piano company. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Unlike the PRC sanctions against our canola seeds?the canola seeds being falsely accused of having severe impurities in their dockage?in this Czech case there is no longer any pretense that there is any legitimate basis for the PRC's threat of trade retaliation if a nation does not comply with the PRC's political agenda. The companies menaced were simply chosen because they have ties to politically influential people in Prague.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The larger question is that Taiwan has a national government utterly in control of its territory, fully legitimated by a liberal democratic election process. Why, then, should the Czech Speaker not go there? The Czech Speaker has not gone, because a few days ago he tragically died suddenly.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Canada has lost the respect of the Chinese regime through our non-action in response to their outrages against us. It is high time for us to kick back by retaliating, especially on China's persistent illegal imports into Canada of the noxious drug fentanyl.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What are the consequences for us? \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We've heard evidence that Canada's external trade with China is about 4.7% of our exports?probably less because of current situations?as compared with 75% with the United States. Most of our sales to China are of primary commodities: canola, soybeans, potash, wood and so on. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the unlikely event that we did incur the wrath of the Chinese regime by standing for our Canadian principles and maintaining the rules-based international order and that China decided to block us further from access to their market in consequence, the consequences would be highly disruptive to certain sectors that need compensation, but I would suggest not as severe as some people who speak in support of China would make out, because these are global commodities that are saleable elsewhere.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Canada's continuing to do nothing in response to China's violations of the accepted norms of international diplomacy and trade will not, in my view, sustain the status quo in our deteriorating relations with China and will certainly not allow us to see movement in achieving the release of Celil, Spavor and Kovrig.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Let me just say one last thing. My friend Anne-Marie Brady spoke to New Zealand's parliamentary inquiry on foreign interference earlier this year. She details the Chinese Communist Party's massive scheme of enticing foreign politicians, academics and business people to promote China's agenda through political lobbying, the media and academia. Besides offering business opportunities or free trips to China by using bribery or honey traps and so on, there are also consultancies in which prominent advisers pocket up to $150,000 U.S. per annum just for being affiliated with PRC entities. As long as the foreign adviser promotes relations with China on PRC terms, the money keeps coming.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I urge that the committee look seriously at Australia's 2018 Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act. Canada needs to come to terms with Chinese money benefiting Canadian political campaigns and rewarding Canadian politicians and public servants who are seen as friends of China.\xa0\xa0(1015)\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mr. Chair, I welcome vigorous and challenging questions from members of the committee on any of these and any other topics. There are many topics that I have been unable to address in this short statement. I do regret that. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Next we have Mr. Calvert', " \n\xa0\nMr. Phil Calvert (Senior Fellow, China Institute, University of Alberta, As an Individual): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Before I start, I want to apologize for my informal appearance. I'm actually just transiting Toronto on the way to go trekking in Turkey, so I'm stopping in to do this.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My statement is about eight minutes. I'll go through it as quickly as I can. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for inviting me to appear before this committee. It is an honour to have the opportunity to discuss the Canada-China relationship, something that occupied a sizeable portion of my career in Canada's foreign service.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I've had the privilege of observing and participating in the Canada-China relationship for over 30 years. This included three postings to our embassy in Beijing between 1984 and 2008, as well as serving as deputy negotiator for Canada during China's accession to the World Trade Organization, and later on as director general for north Asia in what is now Global Affairs Canada. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0These assignments were both fascinating and difficult because managing Canada-China relations, even at the best of times, is challenging. China is complex and full of contradictions. Its diplomatic face can be smooth and sophisticated, or ham-handed and brutish. As Canada has now witnessed first-hand, its reward-and-punishment approach to relations with all but the most powerful of countries means that relations can turn on a dime and suddenly enter a deep freeze. That's what Canada is experiencing now. With the arrests of the two Michaels in retaliation for Canada's detention of Meng Wanzhou, bilateral relations have plunged to their lowest point since Canada and China established diplomatic relations 50 years ago.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Meng Wanzhou case presents some very difficult choices for the government. There is no perfect solution. It can let the case work its way through the court system. If the judge rules that the extradition should proceed, this will lead to a trial and possibly many years of detention and imprisonment under very difficult circumstances for the two Canadians. If the Minister of Justice decides to intervene in the case and release Meng in order to obtain the release of the two Michaels, it rewards China's bad behaviour. Let's not forget that they are not the first Canadians to have been arbitrarily arrested in response to actions by the Canadian government. For this reason, it is imperative that such a decision be part of a broader, comprehensive strategy for managing our relationship with China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0China sees this issue, I believe, in geopolitical terms and Meng's arrest as part of a larger U.S.-led strategy to hinder China's rise and to undermine China's leading companies. They will not back down. For this reason, I believe the only way to obtain the release of the two Michaels is through the release of Meng Wanzhou, either as a result of a judicial decision or action by the Minister of Justice.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If this latter approach is taken, it would need to be part of a broader decision that would include turning down Huawei's 5G application and restoring Canada's access for canola, and other outstanding issues. I also think Canada could play a leading role in crafting a collective response to China's practice of taking hostages. China has been engaged in this practice with virtual impunity for some time, and has arbitrarily imprisoned citizens of a number of countries. If all countries affected by this practice could commit to a common and collective response?trade measures, for example?when a citizen of one of the countries is taken hostage, it would send a strong message to China that such actions will not be tolerated. It's a complex and tough situation, and charting a way forward will be difficult. There's been talk, particularly from China's side, about getting through this current situation and putting the relationship back on track, which implies returning to the way things were before Meng's arrest. I don't think we can go back to the way things were before. This case has done significant harm to China's image in Canada, and has led to a fundamental shift in Canadian attitudes, and in the relationship itself.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0China is and will continue to be important to Canada, both as an economic power and a global player, but the current situation has underscored the importance of approaching China with a critical eye and an understanding of what drives its foreign policy decisions. China's approach to foreign affairs is tough, strategic and driven by power rather than principle. It is almost exclusively focused on advancing its own interests through the exercise of hard and soft power, including in global institutions. Its perspective is informed by its history of being carved up and invaded by foreign powers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Because of this, China is determined never to be weak again and is focused upon returning to its earlier prominence as a global power. Within the Chinese system there is a strong undercurrent of skepticism and suspicion of the west's intentions and ultimate agenda with respect to China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We should also keep in mind that a fundamental driver of Chinese foreign policy, indeed all policy, is keeping the Communist Party in power. The leadership is thus focused on stability, which requires sustained economic growth, peaceful relations at its borders and, increasingly, addressing middle-class concerns about environmental degradation and corruption. Securing and maintaining this stability is also part of Xi Jinping's drive for a stronger global presence and leadership role for his country.\xa0\xa0(1020)\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Successful management of relations with China requires a clear sense of Canada's priorities and interests and a tough-minded commitment to advancing and defending them. Stories of early Canadian missionaries in China, of Norman Bethune and of Canada's decision to sell wheat to China in the wake of the great famine, all provide good imagery and heartwarming content for speeches but are largely irrelevant. China deals in power and respects power. A firm and strategic push-back in defence of Canada's interests and knowing where our leverage lies will garner respect. Being too accommodating out of concern for friendship or fear of offending will make us seem weak. China plays this game well.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0lt is also important for our government to avoid the tendency to view China through a preconceived ideological or political lens or through a single issue. Doing so undermines our capacity to deal with the complex reality of the country and our relationship with it.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The past two decades have seen wide swings in how successive governments have initially approached China. An overarching long-range vision supported by all parties would put Canada in a more advantageous position to consistently manage our relations with this country.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Moving forward, Canada needs a balanced approach based on a realistic understanding of China as it is, the opportunities and the challenges. This approach should also inform Canada's approach to Asia as a whole and our view of China's place in our approach to the region. With its strong focus on China over the last decades, Canada may have overlooked opportunities to form deeper ties with other countries whose markets are easier to navigate and whose systems?in Japan, for example?are based on the rule of law. The CPTPP should help in this rebalancing and diversification of Canada's trade interests in Asia. Canada's public support for broadening the agreement to include Thailand and Taiwan would further help this diversification.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Canada should also give consideration to its relationship with Taiwan, a vibrant and progressive democracy and the only Asian country to approve same-sex marriage. Canada and Taiwan have a healthy trading relationship with good potential for the future. Prime Minister Trudeau's public statement in support of Taiwan's meaningful participation in organizations like ICAO and the World Health Assembly is a good signal, but there is more that Canada could do to advance our interests there. A visit by a Canadian economic minister to support Canadian commercial objectives would respect the parameters of a ?one China? policy and would send an important signal to both China and Taiwan.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Successful management of Canada-China ties requires coordination and coherence. Many federal government departments and most provinces have interests in the country. Although provinces sometimes compete for investment and students, they should be encouraged to buy into Canada's broader agenda in China. On core and important issues like human rights and the two Michaels, Canadian governments at all levels should present a united and consistent front in their discussions with their Chinese counterparts.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Canada-China relations are in a difficult place right now, and there is no easy path forward, but this is also an opportunity to objectively assess the relationship and to develop a realistic and balanced approach to our ties with this important global power.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I wish you all the best in these important deliberations.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Mr. Calvert.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Now we have Mr. Evans", " \n\xa0\nProfessor Paul Evans (Professor, School of Public Policy and Global Affairs, University of British Columbia, As an Individual): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you, Chairman, for the opportunity to appear before the committee, albeit virtually, by video conference from 15,000 kilometres away in Singapore.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I've been studying and teaching international relations for more than 40 years, mostly dealing with U.S.-China and Canada-China relations. The focus of my remarks today will be about government-to-government relations between Canada and China. The overall relationship is, of course, much broader and includes human flows and cultural, business and educational exchanges, but this is an era in which high politics matter and government policies are in flux.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0All of us are aware of how the fates of Michael Kovrig, Michael Spavor and Meng Wanzhou have generated a major diplomatic rift and changed the emotional landscape of feelings and emotions in both countries. Trust and mutual respect have been badly shaken. More recently the COVID-19 virus has affected Canadian interactions with China and our views about how to evaluate the competence of the Government of the People's Republic of China. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the midst of these and other controversies, it's tempting to think that when they're resolved we can revert to normal in our bilateral diplomatic relations. I think this is unlikely. Rather, we have entered new territory, the product of forces much larger than individual incidents and consular cases and much larger than commercial issues like Huawei's potential involvement in our 5G telecommunications network. We are living amidst major shifts in economic, diplomatic and technological power, the emergence of a multi-polar world order and a resurgence of great power rivalry.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0For almost all of the past 50 years, there has been a consensus in Canada about the main outlines of a China policy, one that we came to call ?engagement? and that at one time involved a strategic partnership between our two countries. Engagement was built on three pillars. First, the closer interaction with China was of commercial value and would benefit the prosperity of Canadians. Second, it was initially important to end China's isolation and later to integrate it into what we now call a rules-based international order. Third, it served the moral purpose of supporting economic and societal openness that would lead, over time, to political liberalization in China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Engagement, Canadian-style, depended on a geopolitical context in which Canada had room for independent manoeuvre when it moved in somewhat different directions from Washington?for example in recognizing the PRC eight years ahead of the U.S. Engagement with Canadian characteristics overall was very successful, but it now has to be rethought, not out of anger about specific Chinese actions or fear about the hard edge of growing Chinese power and influence. It needs to be amended because of new circumstances that are not likely to change anytime soon.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The geopolitical and geo-economic balances are shifting. China is now a major global player, present in virtually every international institution and proving capable of creating some of its own. Moreover it is increasingly assertive in pursuing its own interests and in challenging the liberal dimensions of those institutions, particularly as they relate to human rights and democracy. China doesn't need Canadian help in the way it did in the past, and in some instances it is championing positions that challenge us directly.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The belief that economic openness would produce political liberalization now seems mistaken, at least for the time being. Under Xi Jinping, China is more repressive domestically and along its periphery than at any time since Mao Zedong. In addition, a new American consensus has emerged, spearheaded by the Trump administration but with broader bipartisan support, that the American version of engagement is dead. It has been replaced by a framing of China somewhere along a continuum of strategic competitor, adversary, rival or enemy. Washington is engaged in a full-court press, militarily, diplomatically and economically, to counter China's rising influence and power. As Henry Kissinger recently stated, this has led the U.S. and China to ?the foothills of a cold war.?\xa0\xa0(1030)\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As Washington is making abundantly clear in its pressure on Canada and other governments on the matter of Huawei and 5G, the costs of a made-in-Canada choice could be steep. Caught between Xi Jinping's China dream, Donald Trump's America first and a deepening geostrategic competition between the two, what can Canada do?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Let me make three recommendations.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 First, rather than signing up for Cold War 2.0 and the active containment or confinement of China, we need to discuss and define a more flexible policy frame. Engaging in China 2.0, a sort of post-engagement engagement policy, is one way. Another would be co-existing with China. Neither is premised on changing China but on finding ways to live with China. Neither locks China into defined roles as friend or adversary, partner or competitor, ally or existential threat, but allows Canadian interests and values to determine the course of action on an issue-by-issue basis. Co-operate where we can in areas including climate change, global economic and financial governance, peacekeeping, agri-tech and the Arctic, to name a few. Push back where we must, particularly in matters related to interference in our domestic affairs and gross violations of human rights.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Second, we need to fight for the rule-based international order at the same time as we promote its reform in institutions, including the WTO, IMF and the World Bank, and through regional processes like the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership. We need to push back against efforts to unravel or corrode the multilateral rules-based system, whether those challenges come from China or, as we have increasingly seen, from the United States. This will require recapturing a middle power identity that respects our alliance with the U.S. but navigates an independent course in matters like supporting the Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank or giving a balanced assessment of its belt and road initiative, both of which offer new approaches to international co-operation and development. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We will not be with the U.S. or with China in all matters, but we will not be alone. It is worth looking closely at how other countries facing similar dilemmas are adjusting their China policies. A good start would be to look at Australia, Japan, Singapore and perhaps the United Kingdom. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Finally, a new frontier of the relationship is reacting to China's growing presence, influence and occasional interference in Canada. A higher level of awareness and vigilance is needed to protect Canadian values and institutions at home. We need to do this without sensationalizing or exaggerating Chinese activities and their impact, without singularizing China as the only player in the influence and interference business, and without stigmatizing Chinese Canadians by calling into question their integrity and loyalty. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0How, for example, do we keep our doors open to Chinese students and to research exchanges in our universities while closing windows to protect intellectual property and national security in an era of technological competition with China and extraterritorial pressure from the United States? Fashioning a new national consensus and a new narrative for relations with China and building it on a multi-party foundation will not be easy. We haven't tried it in a systematic way since 1966. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The work and recommendations of this special committee have the potential to make a signal contribution.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you so much", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We'll now go to our first round of questions, a six-minute round, with Mr. Albas", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I'd like to thank all of our witnesses for bringing your expertise today.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think I'm going to start with Mr. Evans. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Evans, Graham Allison's book, entitled Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides's Trap?, deals with major shifts in global power and obviously it explores the oft-cited observation from the history of the Peloponnesian War, which deal with events from the fifth century B.C", " namely that it was the rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled in Sparta that made war inevitable.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0According to Mr. Allison, tensions aside, when a rising power threatens to displace a ruling power, the resulting structural stress makes for a violent clash. That's the rule, not the exception. I'd like to start by asking you whether the world is facing a Thucydides's trap with the rise of China", " \n\xa0\nProf. Paul Evans: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We had the opportunity to bring Professor Allison to Ottawa two months ago to talk about his book because, I think you're quite accurate, it has grabbed the imagination of people who see a power shift under way and see the potentialities for major U.S.-China confrontation.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think what Professor Allison is trying to tell us is that unless special efforts are made to reduce tensions between the United States and China, to find new ways to manage relations, that conflict?not just a cold war but something worse?is possible. I think Mr. Allison and a number of Americans are now looking at how to frame that relationship not as China as an adversary or an enemy, but something of a competitor and a partner at the same time, what Mr. Allison calls a ?rivalry partnership?. His message to us in Canada was that we could be supportive of that in a variety of activities and international organizations.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, that is the fear we wake up with every day, and if action isn't taken to mitigate that conflict, then ?destined for war? is a very strong possibility", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Dr. Burton, would you like to rein in the subject?, \n\xa0\nDr. Charles Burton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, I am very concerned about the rise of China, and particularly such phenomena that we see with PRC citizens in key roles in multilateral organizations who seem to be seeking to undermine the purposes of those organizations, presumably under instruction from Beijing. I mean Interpol, ICAO and other UN institutions. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In general, on the Chinese state's penetration into Canada, we don't have adequate laws comparable to other nations about the transfer of classified technologies to agents of the Chinese state. You may have noticed the total number of Canadian cases on this matter over the past few years, to the best of my knowledge, is zero, whereas other countries are able to bring these people to account. There's the case of the Public Security Bureau, of China's agents coming to Canada under false pretenses to pressure persons in our country. Our RCMP's response is that if we discover that someone has come into Canada under false pretenses, under those circumstances, we immediately deport them back to China?no accountability to the person involved.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I am concerned, in general, about the threat of China's desire to undermine the established institutions of the global order, the WTO and the United Nations, and replace them with what party General Secretary Xi Jinping, in October 2017, defined as the ?community of common destiny with mankind?, which is really a reorientation of the global order in the context of his belief that the United States will decline towards China, including the belt and road initiative that will reorient global infrastructure towards Beijing.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's important that we recognize what's going on, and with our allies, particularly the United States, where there is non-partisan political consensus about this issue. It's not just Mr. Trump. His nemesis Speaker Pelosi has also articulated that we need to stand up for the principles of the rules-based order, which protects middle powers like Canada from the arbitrary domination of hegemonic superpowers. I'm particularly concerned about China because of the values gap that informs that regime, which is so different from what makes Canada a great nation", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm reading a book right now that describes the United States' approach as unilateral universalism and the Chinese approach as universal unilateralism?so very different approaches indeed. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm sorry, Mr. Calvert. I don't believe we have enough time to ask you to fill in that, but I will hopefully be raising some more questions.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Fragiskatos', " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos (London North Centre, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you to the witnesses for their very thoughtful perspectives and recommendations. This is a question that I want to put to everyone, to all witnesses, but perhaps I'll begin with Mr. Calvert, based on his career as a diplomat. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When we think about the disputes and challenges that other liberal democracies have faced in recent times with Beijing, what has worked and what has not worked in terms of overcoming those challenges for the liberal democracy, whatever liberal democracy that might be? I emphasize liberal democracy because I think it's important to compare apples to apples. Canada's a liberal democracy, and I'd love to hear any thoughts that the three of you have on that particular issue, because it would be quite useful for this committee to hear that", " \n\xa0\nMr. Phil Calvert: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0One of the things that has worked for some liberal democracies is size and power, that the countries with more political or economic clout naturally have more ability to respond to China's assertiveness in their own interests. I think what works for Canada is more collective action, assembling the like-minded and gathering together to jointly present concerns or common worries that they have in reaction to specific actions that Canada has taken. We've found over the years that Canada sometimes doesn't have the leverage by itself to influence China, but if you can collectively put other nations on side, that sends a stronger message", " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm sorry to cut you off, sir. It's just the time limit.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Professor Evans, are there any concrete examples of how liberal democracies have been able to overcome challenges with China, in specific approaches they've taken: strategies or tactics?, \n\xa0\nProf. Paul Evans: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Liberal democracies have been able, on some matters, to put a focal point on difficulties. It's fascinating to see which have organized to raise some of the special problems of Xinjiang. However, in addressing the challenge of China, the countries we need to work with are more diverse than just liberal democracies.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The balance of force is shifting in such a way that other kinds of countries are trying to have an influence on China, not trying to fundamentally change China's political values and system but some of its behaviours. If you look at the countries of Southeast Asia that are deeply concerned about Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea and their activities around that, they're multilateral but are not premised on us, as western countries, pushing an outcome with China. It's a broader collection.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Those are going to be some of the actions that are going to be necessary to constrain certain Chinese actions, recognizing that almost every country wants to work with China more closely, bilaterally and in its economic interests, but also encouraging Chinese behaviour in a proper direction. To me, it's bigger than a liberal democracy challenge, even though there are special elements of that for us", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Burton', " \n\xa0\nDr. Charles Burton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We should be looking more closely at Australia as a country that has taken certain measures to try to limit Chinese influence through legislation. Certainly, in our own attempt to rally our allies, I believe that this, unfortunately, has probably had the opposite effect to what's intended, in the sense that we can list 14 countries that support us while claiming other countries support us in their hearts but are afraid to say anything.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think the Chinese government would compare 14 against the total number of countries in the world and see that they retain support for their horrendous behaviour. With regard to Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor, like Kevin Garratt before them, the Chinese have been unable to provide us with any evidence of any wrongdoing whatsoever in their case.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It would be wonderful if Canada would take the lead in trying to come up with some multilateral coalition of the like-minded to try to put some transparency and honesty in our relations with China. Currently, there's a psychology in Canada that the most important thing in our relations with China is the promotion of Canadian prosperity through enhanced trade, but the cost that China wants to extract from us for that in pursuit of their overall agenda, such as removing restrictions on Canadian exports of high tech to China, allowing unfettered Chinese state access to Canadian mining and oil or insisting that we install the Huawei 5G into our telecommunications and so on, these things are not worth the cost to Canada in the long run.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0While we, or perhaps some politically connected companies, may achieve profits from collaboration with the Chinese regime, we're better off standing up for our laws and values. If China wants to punish us because of that, then I believe we have to accept the consequences in the overall longer interests of Canada", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you very much, Mr. Fragiskatos.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Bergeron', " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron (Montarville, BQ): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Chairman, I would like to thank our witnesses very much for their presentations, which I found extremely enlightening.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Burton deplored the fact that he certainly had other points to address and other contributions to make.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I invite our witnesses to feel free to send us any comments or observations they may have on any topic at a later date. Their contribution can be most enlightening to our committee.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm trying to summarize everything we've heard from our witnesses, and I've identified four main themes.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First, the mythical era of China-Canada relations based on friendship, collaboration, missionaries, Norman Bethune, Canadian wheat and Canada's recognition of the People's Republic of China before the United States, is over. We are in a new phase.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Secondly, China is obviously a growing power, and it places a value on power or aspiration to power.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Third, therefore, Canada should take a more determined approach and show more firmness towards the government of the People's Republic of China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Fourth and finally, Canada should try to develop a multilateral response to China's actions in violation of the international rules currently in effect which do not seem to be respected in any way by the Chinese authorities.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 In trying to sum up in these four points that you've presented to us, did I do a good reading of what you tried to bring to our attention this morning?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Who is the question for?, \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I am putting it to anyone who wants to answer it", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I guess I'll ask the witnesses. You're probably all interested in answering this. Just to be sure, would you like to raise your hands, if you're interested in answering it?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I see Mr. Burton first", " \n\xa0\nDr. Charles Burton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Absolutely, Mr.\xa0Bergeron, absolutely.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It has always impressed me how effective members of the Parti Qu?becois are in these committees, and I thank you for that. I also have taken on your suggestion that more materials could be sent to the committee, and I will be honoured to provide those things. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I agree with you on all these points that you have raised, which are basically summarizing what I've said. I think it's important that Canada not try to do this alone with China. If we can come up with some consensus, that would be wonderful. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The countries that I find have the best knowledge of communism, including that of the Russians and the Chinese, are countries in eastern Europe, such as the Czech Republic, Poland, Lithuania and so on. These countries understand how these kinds of hegemonic powers work, and I would encourage us to draw broadly on the countries we seek to ally with to try to come up with some way to preserve what's good in our Canadian values and in the way we engage in foreign policy.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Evans', " \n\xa0\nProf. Paul Evans: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Bergeron's question and his summary are intriguing in several ways, and each of the points is going to need to be fleshed in more fully as the committee proceeds with its discussions.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would raise just a possible addition to the fourth point that he raised, about China as an international actor. We have to be realistic that there are certain things China does that we don't like. There are certain kinds of policies that it pursues that anger its neighbours and others. Overall, however, China's involvement in the international system, I would suggest, is in fact stabilizing rather than destabilizing. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On balance, in most of the international institutions in which it operates?in most of the ones that it has created but also the western organizations that have been put in place?China responds and plays a responsible game. It has benefited from the global order that we all put together, with the United States' leadership. In several areas it is trying to be the anchor to that order rather than the destabilizer. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Some of the other witnesses will talk about this in more detail, but we can't frame China exclusively as an outlier or as a threat. In the main, it has been a responsible international citizen. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is that changing? Will it change in future? We're all worried, but at the moment we have to put it into that perspective. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mr. Calvert, I didn't see your hand up so I will go back? \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Oh, yes, you did raise it. Pardon me", " \n\xa0\nMr. Phil Calvert: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I did raise it. Sorry.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I wanted to follow up a bit with something I think I said perhaps not very clearly in my opening statement, which is that any attempt to define China, very simply to label China, as this kind of actor or that kind of actor misses a much more complex story about how it performs internationally. That's not limited to just China, but it is particularly evident in China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In some organizations, as Professor Evans has said, it is a stabilizing influence. In other organizations or other activities, we find its activities and actions less than helpful. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think it has to go back to what China itself sees as how it will benefit. If it will benefit from stability in an organization, if it will benefit geopolitically from assuming a leadership role in an organization, and especially organizations from which the United States has retreated, then it serves its own interests.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0One of the things I've learned about China is that there are no simple answers to any questions you ask about it, and this is another one of those questions", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Harris', " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you to the witnesses for your very informative comments.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Professor Evans, your comments about the international order and China's place in it reflect to some extent the United Kingdom House of Commons report of last April, which says that China's foreign policy goals primarily are designed to protect its domestic political systems, which I think we have heard from Mr. Burton as well. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0They underscore that by saying it doesn't want to change the international world order as such, but it is more interested in showing that its own domestic policies are not challenged. They say that Chinese domestic politics cannot be treated as if it were separate from foreign policy, and the U.K. must adjust its approach to China accordingly. What that means in practice I think they say later on in the report, which I will ask another question on afterwards.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Given that, do you agree with that assessment, that they are not out to change the world in their own image but rather to make sure that their system is prevailing, and perhaps that's a key to understanding what they do internationally?, \n\xa0\nProf. Paul Evans: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0China isn't alone as a great power trying to protect its own international interests and its own value structure in its own country, its own sovereignty. China in that sense is acting in many ways like great powers that we have known in the past and probably will know in the future.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The idea that China has an absolutely clear conception of what it wants a world order to look like is a little misleading. I think there are different strands that we see in Chinese behaviour and attitudes that suggest they don't have a single vision of what they want.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0They do have certain immediate interests. They want to defend them. They want to protect them. They also want to keep globalization alive and moving forward. They have benefited from it, and on balance it's in their interests, but the challenge with China is that in 80% of activities it's a responsible actor. There are things they want to change. Those are mainly around issues related to human rights and democracy promotion, which they feel are antithetical to their interests. So yes, China is a defender of a world order, an international order, but not a defender of a liberal international order.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Something that is very difficult for many of us is that many countries are supportive of China's general approach in this. The balance away from the liberal democracies and the world order, as we understood it, is happening and in part because the United States is stepping away from it as well. These are turbulent times for everyone", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have a lot of questions, frankly, but this one I would ask all of you to comment on, again going back to the U.K. House of Commons, which studied this recently. We have talked about the different aspects of policy, Mr. Burton's views being starkly different from some of the others, but at the end it urged the U.K. government to produce a single detailed public document defining the U.K.'s China strategy.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is that something that is realistic to expect a government like Canada to do? In these circumstances, how do we reconcile the suggestion by Mr. Burton that we should take a very hard line, risk any trade with China, and on the other hand seek to engage China in working with the issues of climate change and others that we have a collective interest in?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mr. Harris, I'm going to have to ask you to indicate who you'd like to...because the time remaining is less than two minutes", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Burton, perhaps you could answer first', " \n\xa0\nDr. Charles Burton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Everyone talks about how this is complex or complicated, but the fact is that General Secretary Xi Jinping's plan is clear. It's what's referred to as the two centenary goals: achievement of elimination of poverty by the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party, which was in 1921?so next year? and achieving a middle-class society by 2035; and then, by the 100th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, which would be 2049?but actually they use 2050?China would become the dominant power on the planet, the belt and road initiative will be achieved and that the institutions will adopt this community of the common destiny of mankind. I think that's clear.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In terms of your other one, do I like the idea that we should be absolutely honest and open and frank and transparent about how we plan to engage in our foreign policy toward the People's Republic of China? Yes, I do believe that it's better not to have secret unknown plans or anything. We should lay it out on the line. We stand for liberal democracy. Paul said that the new world order will not be a liberal world order. I don't want to live in a world that's not a liberal world order", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Do you want to say yea or nay from Singapore? Could you tell us whether you think having a defined policy is a good idea?, \n\xa0\nProf. Paul Evans: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Many of us have claimed for a long time that we need a China policy. I think that what this committee can do is help us set out what the basic theme or melody might be in that relationship. I suggested ?engagement 2.0? or ?co-existing with China?. The Americans and some other countries have set out recent approaches. The Americans' is this adversarial one. Australia's is more nuanced.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We're at a moment where clarity is needed but is going to be extremely difficult to construct. That's why we have such wonderful representatives in Ottawa as our members of Parliament", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Aren't you nice. You're buttering us up.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We will go on to the second round with five minutes each.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Williamson", " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson (New Brunswick Southwest, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you Chairman, and thank you to all our witnesses for being here today.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm going to build a little bit upon some of the remarks that Mr. Bergeron made. What struck me from the testimony was, to some slight degree, everyone seemed to agree that we can't go back. There is no going back to a normal relationship with China, as a result of what has taken place over the last number of years and months, as well as because of a changing and different China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Someone mentioned this, and I'll come back to this. It seems we made a bet over the last generation that we would work to end China's isolation by granting the country most favoured nation status as a way to bring it into the international order and then, after that, into the World Trade Organization. I think I read at one point that even Margaret Thatcher's gamble on Hong Kong was to hand the territory back to mainland China in the hope that it would spark a more liberal approach to its politics, which of course, unfortunately, has not happened.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We are a liberal democracy. China is not, and if anything, it is reverting further away from us, so if what we're seeing is not working, and if the bet has not paid off, it would seem to me that the position of.... What struck me is that your comments run counter to what I hear from official Ottawa?from the Government of Canada policy?both from the ambassador, as well as ranking government officials. Is that correct? If you could maybe all limit your comments to a minute, I'd appreciate it.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Burton, why don't you start since you're right here?, \n\xa0\nDr. Charles Burton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes. I agree. I don't think that our current policy is sufficiently aware of the necessity for Canada to try to stand up for our own values in our engagement with China, in the overall interest of the future of the world.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The question is why it is that so many key policy-makers seem to be reluctant to engage with China in an honest and forceful way. Are some of these people, in fact, to some extent under the influence of Canadian businesses with interests in China, or do they for other reasons adopt positions that mean that they're supporting a policy of engaging with China on Chinese PRC terms?, \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I believe Mr. Calvert also put his hand up", " \n\xa0\nMr. Phil Calvert: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0With respect to previous policies of supporting China's international growth in acceding to organizations like the WTO, maybe some politicians thought that China joining the WTO would bring about liberal democracy. Negotiators didn't. I think what we hoped for from this was perhaps a somewhat better system of commercial law. China's accession to the WTO has benefited both sides. It has benefited companies in the sense of reduced tariffs. While we're not completely happy with how China implements or doesn't implement some of its obligations, it has substantially changed China's trading system?if you compare it to the way it was in 2000 and then the way it was afterwards?in a positive way.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I wouldn't agree with your statement. When we say we can't go back to the way it was before, it doesn't mean we don't want to engage China in some new way. We need to work with China and its presence in the international community. Yes, we have to be firm, but we have to be intelligent about how we engage China and choose where our interests lie and where we can work with China internationally and where we collide with our interests.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the case of human rights, if we're going to articulate human rights concerns, lecturing is not effective. It sometimes is necessary, but we should be also giving a business case for it", " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's fair enough, but I'm curious. Would you agree, then, that continuing to ratchet up?or the path we're on?is not the way to go? For example, we have worked to bring China into what I will call the international economic order, the WTO. The next step would be a free trade agreement with China, which would, of course, deepen those ties. Do you think that is the next step, or should we be very wary of entering into a free trade agreement with a country that is known to steal technology and is, frankly, not a market-oriented player in its outlook of economics in the way Canada and other western countries are?, \n\xa0\nMr. Phil Calvert: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I believe now we should be very careful about entering into a free trade agreement with China. I think what has been demonstrated by China, especially in the last year with us, is that the rule of law continues to be a challenge. If you want to have a free trade agreement with a country, you have to have some confidence that it's going to implement its obligations bilaterally. I don't think this is the time, and frankly, I don't think there's a political will to do so anyway on the Canadian side", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Go ahead, Ms. Yip', " \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip (Scarborough?Agincourt, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My question is directed to Professor Evans. Thank you for staying up so late to participate.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In your statement you mentioned three strategies or recommendations Canada could consider. Could you elaborate on what you meant by flexible policy framework?, \n\xa0\nProf. Paul Evans: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This has to do with the matter of how we define China on a spectrum: from a friend, to a partner, to a rival, to an adversary, to an enemy. Where on that spectrum do we do it? I'm suggesting that it depends on the issue that we're dealing with regarding China, and that no one hat fits all wearers. As we move forward with China, we have to see that we have a variety of interests: the commercial, the international agenda we're pushing, the development objectives we would like to see in the world. China is multiple things at the same time. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This is not a problem when we think about the United States. When we think about the United States, particularly in this era, we're looking at a country that is pulling in several different directions at the same time. Just as with the United States, we now increasingly look on an issue-to-issue basis rather than with one single formula. That flexibility that is going to come by engagement in the broadest sense of the word rather than in the way we pursued in the past, I think that's the track we're going to have to go forward on because of the new power dynamics in play", " \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Could you comment further on how we can work together with China in peacekeeping, the Arctic and the environment?, \n\xa0\nMr. Phil Calvert: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Each of those need special attention. I would raise one in particular, which is peacekeeping. It's a perfect example of the choices we make. For some, working with China on peacekeeping is co-operating with a future enemy and their activities. China is now the largest player in international peacekeeping of the P5 countries.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I take a different view. I think that on peacekeeping, Canadian experience and Chinese capabilities, there are several areas where we can co-operate and where the world urgently needs an enhanced peacekeeping capability.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To use that as an example, there are the case studies, some of which your committee might be willing to take on, where we do have some commonality of interest, recognizing there are risks we have to take account of during that process. We could give an itemized list if you wish. We've been working on a dozen or 15 different areas where we think there are special chances for co-operation that might benefit both of us, but also the world that we'd like to see", " \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It would be helpful if you could send that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Why do you think they have the largest peacekeeping force or that they are represented so strongly around the world? Does it have anything to do with the belt and road initiative?, \n\xa0\nProf. Paul Evans: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think China's use of its military is complicated. It is increasingly having its forces based in other countries, but only a small number. The United States has over 400 foreign military bases. China has?depending on how you count them?two or three or four.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There are mixed motives in what China is doing. The argument is that, because they have the resources, they have the troops that they're willing to put in and they have a marvellous training system that has been internationally supported, we can try to accentuate the positive with them, with eyes open, for other motives that we have to try to discourage in the longer term as well", " \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have 30 seconds. I don't know if this can be answered in 30 seconds, but it's directed to all the panellists.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0China has conveyed its appreciation to the government's response regarding the coronavirus emergency. How likely is it that this will contribute to a thaw in the Canada-China relations? Is there?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We have time for a one-word answer from each member. You want to say ?very? or ?not at all?.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Burton", ' \n\xa0\nDr. Charles Burton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Definitely', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Calvert', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Phil Calvert: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Minimal', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Evans', ' \n\xa0\nProf. Paul Evans: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think the coronavirus can be a significant plus or a significant negative in our relationship with China', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Alleslev, you have five minutes', " \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev (Aurora?Oak Ridges?Richmond Hill, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This has been incredible in moving the discussion. What I've heard, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, is that overall our current approach is not serving us in the best way possible, that there is a sense of urgency to address that lack of, or weakness in, our current approach, and that some of the suggestions are around the benefit that Canada has as a middle power in being able to rely on other like-minded countries, either in the region or in the broader western world, or simply within our own country, to have a single voice and find a way to re-establish the strength of international institutions to be able to protect and preserve middle powers in a world where we're seeing the rise of great powers.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What I would like to hear from all of you, from your perspective, is what specific actions we can take to engage and strengthen those collective, coordinated approaches with other like-minded countries who find themselves in similar situations and even within our own country.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Burton", " \n\xa0\nDr. Charles Burton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It would be great if Canada took the initiative, as we've taken most recently with the conference on North Korea and the land mines. Canada has a history of coordinating with like-minded powers to achieve goods for the global community. I think we also need to strengthen our capacity to engage with the Chinese regime. Under Ambassador Gotlieb, we changed the way we engaged in Washington, from beyond the State Department into Congress, into local legislatures and all the areas of power in the United States. In China we're falling very far behind in our capacity to engage with the people who count inside China and who are involved in the policy-making process that is affecting us so badly. I would certainly encourage that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The other thing is that we keep talking about China, but we're really talking about the current government of China under Xi Jinping. I think that will not last forever. We shouldn't be feeling that there's a destiny here of the end of liberal democracy in global affairs. We could be engaging agents of change within China and supporting people we identify in China as doing good. We've done this before with human rights' dialogues and civil society programs, and senior judges' training. On my two postings as a diplomat in China, I was very much involved in those. All of those initiatives failed, but I don't think we ought to give up on the idea of democracy in China", ' \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Evans', " \n\xa0\nProf. Paul Evans: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think we're facing a double challenge: a China challenge and an America challenge. In building or rebuilding an international order, we're going to have to work with both of those countries as best we can, for example, by getting them into some of the new multilateral trade organizations. It won't work globally, but the trans-Pacific partnership should have accession clauses where we could imagine both China and the United States, when they are willing and able, to come into them.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would say, secondly, that where we can try to work together as middle powers is, with special reverence to here in Southeast Asia, through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The idea of these?, \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you. I want to make sure that I give Mr. Calvert an opportunity, too. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Considering it was a very significant emphasis of your opening remarks, what action can we take, Mr. Calvert?, \n\xa0\nMr. Phil Calvert: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First of all, we have specific issues. This has to be an issue-by-issue sort of decision, focusing on choosing. For example, with respect to the two Michaels, there are a number of countries, as I mentioned, that have had hostages taken. Collectively they can get together and say, ?Okay, the next time a citizen is taken from one of our countries we will have a common response to this.? We can pull people together who have common interests in other areas as well. That's what our diplomats do.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I also think that, building on what Professor Burton says, we have a lot of trade commissioners in China but we don't have an adequate representation of officers in our embassies who do political and advocacy work. There are a lot more resources that could be put in that direction. Making more connections with the party system, with local governments and everything is where we can find ways to advance our interests and to try to influence the government.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to say one more thing?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Calvert, I'm sorry. We haven't time. We're over time a bit there.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Zann", " \n\xa0\nMs. Lenore Zann (Cumberland?Colchester, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Good day, gentlemen, whatever time zone you happen to be in.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have three questions, one for each of you, so keep that in mind. I'm going to start with Mr. Burton. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Burton, what do you think would be the concrete consequences of a very tough policy response on Canada-China relations going forward to Chinese behaviours we disagree with?, \n\xa0\nDr. Charles Burton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm fairly confident that because the relationship between Canada and China is so asymmetrical in favour of China, we would not get this negative response. I think we would gain respect from China. They would expect us to not simply be passive in response to the successive outrages that they have committed against the rules-based global order, and diplomacy and trade.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I really think, for example, that we should crack down on the activities of agents of the Chinese state in Canada, on money laundering in B.C", " which affects some people connected to the senior leadership of the regime?that's why, I think, they protect Ms. Meng so carefully?and other actions such as inspecting shipments from China strictly to stop this fentanyl scourge from coming into our country. There are a lot of things we could do.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Frankly, I understand that we can't predict that regime and they don't seem to behave in a way that is fair or reciprocal, as one would expect in global relations. I'm not that worried that if we show some backbone, we will suffer disastrous consequences for our economy and relations, but it's a continuing story", " \n\xa0\nMs. Lenore Zann: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Calvert, what have you learned as a diplomat or professor about the best way to engage China, even when we have disagreements with them?, \n\xa0\nMr. Phil Calvert: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would say two things.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 One is that tone is important, as it is with any kind of relationship, and that while public statements are sometimes useful, they are also blunt instruments and have to be matched with other kinds of engagement that takes place out of the public eye.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Second, I would say that the more you can provide a business case for convincing them that what you're trying to, let's say, advocate for China is in their interests and not just an extension of our own values, the more it can be effective.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0For example, on human rights issues, if you can make the argument.... For example, on the coronavirus, if you want to talk about transparency and governance, you can make a business case for China right now, behind closed doors, saying, ?Look, you lost a month of potential activity that could have possibly contained this virus, because of your system, because of the way you control, with the lack of transparency and your crackdown on the very people who were trying to draw attention to this. This should tell you something.? Basically, you can argue that respect for human rights and for more democracy is ultimately more stable and ultimately provides more possibility for addressing challenges and long-term challenges in any country. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Also?for example on the Uighur issue, which is abominable in the way they're treating them?we can bring Canada's experience to bear and say, ?Look, we have our own experience in the way we have treated our indigenous people. It has been very costly in social and financial terms because of the incredible mismanagement of it.? The more you can present issues in that way, the more you're going to find some kind of willing listener", " \n\xa0\nMs. Lenore Zann: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Excellent. Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have one last question. This is for you, Mr. Evans.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0How much room do we have for pursuing an independent China policy that might cut across the American policy of treating China as its strategic competitor, adversary or enemy?as for example, with Huawei?, \n\xa0\nProf. Paul Evans: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Huawei question is exactly the right one to ask, because it is where these forces come together, and the challenges of a made-in-Canada decision are really important as a signal of where we're going to go.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think the consensus in the United States is somewhat cracking on the Huawei issue, even if it isn't represented at this moment among their elected officials. Business think tanks and others see the dangers of decoupling and are backing off from that hardline full confrontation", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm sorry, but we have very little time for each of our members to ask their questions.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Bergeron, you have two and a half minutes", " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you Mr.\xa0Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I understand that Canada's policy on China has been completely revised. I noted Mr.\xa0Burton's comment that we also need to change our approach to China, as we did with the United States. What role do you think the provinces can play in that change?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Next, I'd like to ask a question that could be addressed to all three of you and that we can hardly ask of the officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs: how well equipped is Canada today in terms of personnel and analysts?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Finally, I'd like to refer back to one of Mr.\xa0Calvert's interventions in response to a question from Ms.\xa0Alleslev: is Canada well equipped to deal with this paradigm shift we're seeing with respect to China?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Which witness is your question for, Mr.\xa0Bergeron?, \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It is for all three witnesses", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Please tell us which of the three witnesses you would like to hear first, Mr.\xa0Bergeron', ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My first question is for Mr.\xa0Burton. Please proceed, we are wasting time', " \n\xa0\nDr. Charles Burton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Certainly we've had some very effective representatives in China from our provinces. I know of some from the province of Quebec, when I was serving in the embassy, who were particularly strong not only in trade but also in general in the discussions that occur between diplomats in that posting.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Do we have the analysts we need to defend our interests in China adequately? I would say that we do not. It's very difficult to get people with the requisite expertise in understanding the Communist system, fluency in the Chinese language and the willingness to spend a lot of time engaging with their Chinese colleagues. This is not a problem simply for Canada, but it is a big problem for Canada.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The thing is that there is no short-term solution. Many countries at present are providing scholarship incentive programs to graduate students to acquire this expertise. We really have to get serious about it, but it's not something we can solve in the short term", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Professor Evans. , \n\xa0\nProf. Paul Evans: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think the question of the province and Asian competence is very interesting, because it takes us back to our universities. I think one of the areas that the committee could be of great value is in looking at the role of the universities and the challenges they now face in dealing with China. Some of those are opportunities in terms of recruitment of students, but there are whole new challenges about protecting?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you. Sorry to interrupt, but the two and a half minutes are up. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Harris, you have two and a half minutes. , \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Chair. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0A lot of Canadians, as we all know, are very motivated by concern for human rights in China, whether it be the Uighurs or the case of the imprisonment of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig. Throughout the history of our relationship, we've always demanded that the Prime Minister raise the question of human rights in meetings with the leadership of China. These things have been going on for 50 years. My question is this. Are the international human rights mechanisms that are available capable of playing a role in solving this issue, or do we need other things? We have public statements, we have normal diplomatic channels, etc", " but are there any other things that we could or should be doing that could help us?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could each of you address that? Is there anything else that we're missing here?, \n\xa0\nDr. Charles Burton: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Harris, the UN institutions are not very effective. I note that North Korea has ratified both of the main human rights covenants. Clearly, we're not able to get them to be in compliance. From that point of view, I think some of these institutions to some extent have been co-opted by the power of China in the UN to prevent nations from supporting exposure of Chinese human rights abuses. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As I said in my opening statement, we do have the Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act, the Magnitsky list, and I think it's a glaring shortcoming that the country that has committed the most human rights abuses on the planet is excluded from our Canadian list. , \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Go ahead, Dr. Evans. , \n\xa0\nProf. Paul Evans: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think this is a very interesting problem that you've identified: what we are going to do with China on human rights. I would say that public attitudes are quite interesting. When we ask Canadians what they think our government's major priority should be with respect to China, human rights consistently comes up fourth on the list, after trade, after co-operation on global issues and after protection of Canadian values and institutions at home. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0How far we put this as a priority is important. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Give a 15-second answer, Mr. Calvert. Sorry", " \n\xa0\nMr. Phil Calvert: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If we want to change China as a whole, that's going to be very difficult. We have to find specific, small, concrete issues and work to convey to China why it's in their interest to do this, find areas where we can work together collectively and build out on what we can do from there. We used to have a human rights dialogue?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you. Sorry about that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I thank the witnesses very much. We do deeply appreciate your time here and your understanding of the fact that each member only has so much time, so we have to roll through these quite quickly. I invite all the witnesses to send additional information in writing to the clerk if you wish to do so.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We'll suspend for five minutes?, \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Can I read a motion into the record?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Do you want to move a motion?, \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Excuse me. I mean I want to move a motion. I move: \n\n\n\n That the clerk of the committee make the necessary arrangements for a working lunch on Thursday, February 27, 2020.\n\n\n, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We'll come back to that after the break. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We'll suspend for five minutes to allow the witnesses to leave and to get the new witnesses and teleconferences in place. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you again. \xa0\xa0(1130)\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\xa0(1135)\xa0\xa0\n\n, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I call the committee back to order.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We have our second session now.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0With us we have Jeremy Paltiel, professor in the department of political science at Carleton University. By video conference from Vancouver, British Columbia, we have Yves Tiberghien, professor, department of political science and faculty association, school of public policy and global affairs, University of British Columbia. From the Canada West Foundation, we have Carlo Dade, director, trade and investment centre, along with Sharon Zhengyang Sun, trade policy economist in the trade and investment centre.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We'll begin with Mr. Paltiel", " \n\xa0\nDr. Jeremy Paltiel (Professor, Department of Political Science, Carleton University, As an Individual): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Members of the Commons Special Committee on Canada-China Relations, I thank you for the honour of testifying before you today.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I am very grateful for the opportunity to testify before you, and I will be happy to answer your questions in English or French.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 This year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral relations between the People's Republic of China and Canada. It also marks the 50th anniversary of my starting to learn Chinese. I see this as a particularly opportune moment from which to examine our bilateral relationship. My presentation is in three parts. In the first part I review the pattern of our relationship. In the second, I offer my perspective on the nature of the Chinese regime and the constraints this imposes on our bilateral relations and our alliance relations. In the third, I offer some perspective on the current state of our relations and how we may move forward.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We negotiated the establishment of bilateral relations beginning in 1968, a time when the People's Republic of China was largely isolated diplomatically during the unprecedented turmoil known as the Cultural Revolution. The premise of our initiative was not to endorse the Chinese regime, nor was it that China would transform itself into Canada. The human rights situation was then much worse than it is today. Underlying our establishment of diplomatic relations?and I defer to Professor Paul Evans on this question, since he literally wrote the book?was to bring China into the community of nations for the sake of global peace and security, as well as to diversify our foreign relations and trade and to show ourselves to be an independent global actor.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Our effort was eventually rewarded beyond our initial hopes. The People's Republic of China took its seat as a permanent member of the UN Security Council within months of the establishment of diplomatic relations in October 1970. Within 10 years, China began the process of reform and opening up, which led to China's spectacular rise. Canada played a role as a partner in China's reform and opening through our CIDA program, which began in 1981. China's reform and opening turned into a hope that China's reform would lead it to being a full participant in the liberal international order.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This initial hope was contradicted by the events of Tiananmen in 1989. When China's economic reforms resumed in 1991-92, our CIDA programs also continued, and hope was reignited, albeit on a more cautious and more long-term trajectory. China's efforts to join the World Trade Organization were symbolic of this renewed effort, and it was in this context in 1998 that then Chinese premier Zhu Rongji called Canada ?China's best friend in the world.? Canadian efforts facilitated the adaptations of China's legal system and its institutions to the demands of an open trading system when China entered the WTO in January 2001.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the 21st century, China no longer needs Canada to tutor it, nor to open doors for it. Just as China's success grew apparent, our relationship lost its overall strategic rationale. The spectacular growth of the Chinese economy became the new justification for our relationship, but we were disappointed that our previous history granted us no special privileges in the Chinese market. Even the team Canada approach failed to arrest the decline in our market share of the Chinese economy, and our trade fell into persistent deficits that see us buying basically two dollars of goods for every dollar we sell. We have not been able to establish a strategic focus in our relations under both Liberal and Conservative governments. Over the past decade and a half, as China's power has grown, our disappointed hopes have become increasingly tinged with fear.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In terms of the nature of the Chinese regime, since Xi Jinping rose to power at the 18th party congress in 2012, China has moved from a defence of China's difference as an exception to the universality of liberal values to celebration of its governance based on its own cultural traditions and achievements of the Communist regime.\xa0\xa0(1140)\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Xi has been careful not to broadcast that the Chinese model should be copied or imposed, but nonetheless offers his country's experience as a model for developing countries to learn from. However, it is worth remembering that at the time when Canada recognized China, in October 1970, Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party still espoused global revolution and the overthrow of capitalism. That is not the case today. Beijing's concerns about liberal democracy largely stem from its fears about the domestic security of its own regime. lt does not seek to aggressively undermine regimes abroad. It?s not Russia. As the world's greatest exporter, China is inherently committed to an open, rules-based international trading order. China is trying to cement its status through initiatives like the belt and road initiative and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0These efforts to increase prosperity and connectivity through the BRI and the AIIB are not in themselves a threat to Canada. Investment in public goods, like infrastructure, will pay dividends even if we are not direct beneficiaries or participants. Moreover, closer engagement will allow us to exercise some influence, such as our membership in the AIIB, over the direction and management of these programs. We confront China as a successful competitor that has adapted market methods to achieve state-led goals. This is a challenge, but it is not a threat to the rules-based order in itself.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0China's Leninist regime is designed to insulate the political leadership from outside influence, domestic or international, so its entire outlook is based on insulating itself from the outside internally and externally. However, the continued survival of the Chinese Communist Party?the People's Republic of China has now survived longer than the Soviet Union did?requires it to adapt and learn. China is sensitive, in the best and worst sense of the term, to outside opinion and to criticism from below.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Chinese dream of China's great rejuvenation represents joining the world, not isolating China from it. One concrete expression of this is the hundreds of thousands of Chinese students in Canada. Our strategy must allow for different representations of the will of the Chinese people, while recognizing that the Chinese government we are dealing with is the government that is empowered to make commitments by the Chinese state. We have no control or say on how it may change or when.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Canadian prosperity and global influence depend on having a workable relationship with China. Right now we have the worst relationship with China of any of the G7 countries, but there are signs that our relationship is thawing. This provides hope for improvement, but I share with other Canadians the conviction that there can be no fundamental improvement in the relationship until the two Michaels go free. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Chinese have an expression they employ often in their diplomacy called qiutong cunyi, which means emphasize points of agreement while reserving differences. We must craft a strategy that allows us to do that even though we have serious, ongoing human rights concerns, particularly as regards Xinjiang. We cannot disentangle China from the fate of the globe, and any hope of isolating or containing China is doomed to fail. There is a whole agenda of issues, including climate change and global health, where we have no choice but to work with China. Our prosperity, like China's, depends on an open, rules-based trading system. We cannot safeguard that system and a healthy environment for global innovation without China", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Paltiel, you have 35 seconds. You can wrap up, please, if you don't mind", ' \n\xa0\nDr. Jeremy Paltiel: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have a few more comments, but basically the premise of our engagement is not to remake China in our own image, but to co-operate in areas of common interest and to reserve a space where critical concerns will be listened to on the basis of reciprocity. We have to obviously move to one where we have to emphasize reciprocity more and more. Apart from the fact that China no longer needs us to open doors, we have too many pressing concerns to ignore.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I will submit my other comments and let the other commentators go forward', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 That's 10 minutes, bang on. Thank you very much for your co-operation.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Tiberghien. , \n\xa0\nProf. Yves Tiberghien (Professor, Department of Political Science, and Faculty Associate, School of Public Policy and Global Affairs, University of British Columbia, As an Individual): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr.\xa0Chair and members of the committee.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I am honoured to contribute to your deliberations today by sharing with you some of the fruits of my research and observations on Canada-China relations.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I commend the important work of your committee, and I recognize the urgency of assessing this relationship, given the situation of our fellow citizens incarcerated in China, specifically, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. We all recognize the bad turning point in the Canada-China relationship since the arrest of Ms.\xa0Meng Wanzhou on December\xa01, 2018, and the arrest of the two Michaels on December\xa010, 2018.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I also acknowledge that we are talking here in the middle of a public health crisis wherein we have many diplomats in China, including the ambassador, and where the biggest lockdown of cities in the modern age has taken place, with terrible suffering. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I also will take this chance to thank the clerk of the committee and the staff for making a difference every day, including the pages, Hansard, translators and clerks. I have a student now who served as a page last year, and it was a fantastic training ground. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'd like to start with two key points. Then I'll focus on some key aspects of the international system as it relates to Canada-China and offer some points on China and some implications for Canada. First, the Canada-China downturn is part of a larger period of great disruption in global politics. Every country today is adjusting its posture in international affairs and is responding to the moves of others. Second, in this context, Canada's priorities are to be robust in defence of the national interest and in finding actionable pathways to defend the rules-based international order with key partners. Effective multilateralism must underpin Canada's action in the international arena.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Now I'll offer some points on the international context and how it impacts upon the Canada-China relation. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I call this the age of disruptions. To a large extent, the Canada-China crisis is part of the larger U.S.-China crisis and is a prism for the challenges to the rules-based order. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Let me elaborate on five key drivers and their impact. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First, we're living through a crisis of globalization. We see peaking trade flows, a move toward the regionalization and deglobalization of global supply chains. Globally induced inequalities have led to great polarization and tensions in most advanced democracies. This is an age of anxiety and anger in countries such as the U.S", ' the U.K', " France, Italy, Greece, Poland and many others. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Second, we're facing systemic shifts in our economic system due to the combination of climate change and the fourth industrial revolution. These two forces are creating heightened competition. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Third, we have just lived through one of the greatest shifts in economic power in modern history. Between 2000 and 2018, more than 20% of global GDP in nominal dollars shifted hands from OECD countries to emerging economies. Of this shift, 60%?that is, 12 points?went to China. The rest went to India, Southeast Asia, central Asia and Africa. The IMF estimates that Asia represents 60% of world growth today and for the next decade. The open economy facilitated that shift, yet it's also important to note that China and India are essentially returning to where they were for 2,000 years until 1820, that is, before the industrial revolution and colonization. As part of this change we see a more assertive China but also a more assertive India, Russia, Indonesia and Africa. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Fourth, China today represents 16% of world GDP nominal dollars and 19% in PPP terms. That's 2018 data. From 2012 to 2020, China has represented one-third of global growth. China is a giant in every domain, from health to renewable energy to AI, big data, international students and UN peacekeeping soldiers. We cannot work on any global issue in the world today without working with China. We also observe a recoupling of Asian sub-regions, such as South Asia, Southeast Asia, central Asia and China. Those regions had been disconnected since colonial times?for more than 200 years, and in fact since the fall of Tamerlane, the last Mongol ruler, in 1405. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Fifth, we're currently witnessing a shock in the international order as the U.S", " the leader that created the liberal order, is, under the Trump administration, turning against many of the multilateral institutions that the U.S. created and has nurtured since World War II. We don't know yet whether it's a bargaining readjustment or a longer-term disruption to the 100-year search for order, going back to Woodrow Wilson following World War I. \xa0\xa0(1150)\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The consequence of those five disruptions and systemic changes is a period of growing geopolitical rivalry. I see tremendous dynamism. I also see tremendous misperceptions, since every power is reading the actions of the others through its own historical frame and narratives. For example, the arrest of Madam Meng Wanzhou in December 2018 led to extremely powerful reactions among the Chinese public and within the government, revealing great misunderstanding about Canada's true intentions. Of course, the same is true on the Canadian side. You may unlock such misunderstandings by looking for clues in Europe. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm also struck that the Internet has not narrowed perceptions among groups or nations, but increased them due to echo chamber effects and overload. In this context, it's essential to start by understanding what drives and motivates other players, so as to find actual pathways to get things done. It's crucial to avoid emotional tit-for-tat cycles that lead to everybody being worse off.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As a case in point, see the EU's wake-up call with the last op-ed written by Josep Borrell, the current High Representative of the EU, on February 8, 2020, in Project Syndicate. He urged Europe to wake up to a world where big players don't play according to rules but practise issue linkage and power politics. He urged the EU to have strategic thinking, to build leverage and coalitions. We hear similar views from our key ally in Asia, Japan.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Now I will say a few things about China and Chinese governance and Chinese perceptions.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0China is complex and paradoxical. It has gained great international power yet faces more domestic and global uncertainties today than at any time since the end of the Mao era. Here are a few of the challenges.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First, about Chinese governance, if you've talked to members of the Chinese middle class in recent years, you get a sense of great hope and emergence from great trauma. China was a wealthy and peaceful country in 1820, representing 30% of the world's economy. After 1820, China lived through two opium wars and the loss of trade and foreign autonomy to western powers and Japan, and there were great peasant rebellions that killed upward of 50 million people in the late 1800s. The great hope of the 1911 revolution with Sun Yat-Sen was followed immediately by fragmentation into warlord-held regions, civil war for decades, invasion by Japan that killed another 20 million, more civil war and the Korean war. China did have a few good years from 1952 to 1957, followed by the madness of the anti-rightist campaign, the Great Leap Forward with a famine that killed 50 million more, followed in turn by Mao's cultural revolution. No wonder the middle class supports stability and sees the current decades as the best time in China in 150 years, an age of prosperity and possibility. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There is, of course, broad support for the regime. Many Chinese feel a sense of great progress, growing wealth and prosperity, greater freedom?except for political freedom, particularly the ability to criticize the party.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There is also, of course, increasing desire for information and voice, especially on social media. At the same time, given that the middle class is only 25% of the population, it's not yet in its interest to hand power to the other 75%, the rest of the population. Think of Thailand and the yellow vest push-back against democratically elected Thaksin. What I hear, however, are aspirations for evolution over time that would yield better political freedom and governance without the trauma of national fragmentation or past dynastic change. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Second, given a long and sophisticated political history over thousands of years and China representing a big share of humanity's collective experience, the Chinese people and government alike expect recognition for that heritage. The current government may be Leninist in structure, but it often behaves like a government that inherited practices and norms from past dynasties.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Third, while China does not buy in to the political pillar of the liberal order, governance is nonetheless fragmented and pluralistic. Despite Xi Jinping's very strong accumulation of power and crackdowns on many fields like media, the structure of power remains collective leadership. When Xi doesn't get the support of the 25-strong politburo or the seven-strong standing committee, he cannot move forward. In fact, to stay on for a third mandate after 2022?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Excuse me, Mr.\xa0Tiberghien, you have 30\xa0seconds left. Could you conclude your presentation, please?, \n\xa0\nProf. Yves Tiberghien: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0China's policy output has zones of darkness and zones of light and progress. The more insecure China is, the more it tightens control. We need to find effective ways to deal with this.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The implications for Canada are as follows. We cannot wish China would go away. We have to deal with the China we have. We need a differentiated approach with China, with certain practices and national interests. We have to protect our security, but the longer term of Canada is to buttress the rules-based international order and to make sure China gets integrated into it. We must focus on outcomes", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We now have the Canada West Foundation. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I understand that Mr. Dade and Ms. Sun will be sharing the 10 minutes.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you', " \n\xa0\nMr. Carlo Dade (Director, Trade and Investment Centre, Canada West Foundation): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, that's correct.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Before we begin, and as always, we would like to thank the committee, the chair and the clerk for their assistance.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for the invitation to be here. This makes two times in two weeks for the Canada West Foundation to be in Ottawa testifying before Parliament on issues of great importance, obviously to Canada, but also to the west. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This is where our testimony will focus today. If we had 30 minutes to go it alone, we would stay with the high-level discussions, but we'd like to bring the testimony down to some concrete elements about our engagement.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I trust too, Mr. Chair, that since we're the only institutional speaker today we can get an extra 15 to 20 seconds to describe our institution", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0No, I'm sorry", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Carlo Dade: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Once again, then, the west is shut out.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Some hon. members: Oh, oh!, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Everyone gets equal time', " \n\xa0\nMr. Carlo Dade: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0All kidding aside, the Canada West Foundation was created 50 years ago for moments much like today to ensure that the west has a voice in affairs that shape the country, but more to assure that the west can contribute to creating a strong and prosperous Canada. A strong west is a strong Canada, and nowhere is that more evident than in our relations with Asia.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We've been through some difficult times, the west and the country. We are in some now, but we continue to work towards that vision of a strong west in a strong Canada. Given what's happened today, we just hope that the rest of the country will continue to respond and to reach out to us.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On Asia and engagement, we have three points today for the committee. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Asia and Canada's engagement has been a focus for the Canada West Foundation. We carried out modelling?economic impact assessments?that members in another committee asked that the government do, so that Parliament could actually have data, intelligence and information to understand trade agreements. We did it for the CPTPP in advance of the government's doing it. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That information was critical for the committee to understand. It was critical for the country to have the data, to understand and to keep the country and the government from making the calamitous mistake of walking away from the TPP agreement. Given the way our relations with the U.S. and our relations with China have gone, it's easy to see not just how prescient but how important that sort of information was.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We have three points for the committee, and we hope these will guide your thinking going forward and guide your questioning of other witnesses. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The first is that Canada's relation with China flows through the west. The west is the centre and the focus of our engagement with China. Yes, other parts of the country are involved, but it is in the west that the rubber meets the road. It is the west that is implicated immediately, in ways that other parts of the country aren't. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Second, agriculture is a key part of this relationship. The data that you have before you, which my colleague will walk you through, shows this. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Third, agriculture may offer an idea of what the solution is or how we begin to build on re-engagement.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It may facilitate the renewal of this relationship at the appropriate time.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It is how we can potentially re-engage when the time is right.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I will now turn it over to my colleague, our trade policy economist, to walk us through some of the data", " \n\xa0\nMs. Sharon Zhengyang Sun (Trade Policy Economist, Trade and Investment Centre, Canada West Foundation): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr.\xa0Dade.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr.\xa0Chair.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'll start with some numbers. Even though the U.S. is and will continue to be our largest trading partner, the average growth of two-way trade with China over the last 10 years has been 12%?that compares with 4% with the U.S.?and 65% of this two-way trade with China comes from the four western provinces. China has become an important trading partner for Canada and for western Canada.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Our engagement with our second largest trading partner will continue to grow. [English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Trade with China is particularly important for agriculture. If you look at diagram six in the testimony I've shared with you, you see that more than $10 billion, or 37% of Canada's total export to China, is agricultural and that 75% of this agricultural export to China comes from the four western provinces of Canada.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This is why a poor relationship with China is detrimental to Canadian trade, particularly in the west.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We've observed evidence of this in our recent issues with China on canola, on pork, on beef and on soy. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Canada, therefore, needs market access certainty with China, which means reducing or mitigating arbitrary actions that have harmed farmers and diminished Canadian exports. This means addressing non-tariff barriers in the long term for Canadian agriculture.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0While trade in agriculture is important for Canada?it's important for western Canada?agriculture or food security specifically is very important for China. We've seen clear indications of this in their five-year plans. We see evidence of it in ?made in China 2025?, their industrial policy that aims for self-sustainability in agriculture as one area by focusing on smart agricultural technology. We see evidence of it in the belt and road initiative that focuses on transportation and infrastructure connectivity by land and by sea as an indication for longer-term agricultural supply certainty.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0OECD also has projections on agricultural consumption by 2028. China comes first for many of the agricultural sectors that are important for Canadian export, such as pork, oilseeds, protein meal, soybean and cereal.\xa0\xa0(1205)\xa0\xa0\n\n[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0So China's interest is agri-food security and Canada's interest is certainty of access to the Chinese market. Agriculture is therefore a key interest shared by both countries, but this interest is driven by different needs", " \n\xa0\nMr. Carlo Dade: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Indeed, if you look at the interests of agriculture, on the one hand China needs food security?access to certainty on access to supply. Even though China is moving to become self-sufficient in certain commodities, the overall demand means that they will always need foreign inputs, not simply as a backstop but to feed the population. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On the other hand, Canada needs market access certainty. If we are going to have producers risk farms, risk investments, risk things that have been in their families for generations, we need certainty about access to markets. That certainty has just been redefined by the U.S.-China phase one trade agreement. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0At Canada West, we're engaged on a project to examine how other countries are dealing with non-tariff barrier issues with China. We've looked at Australia and New Zealand, obviously, but also Brazil. I would suggest that at the committee you always hear Australia, New Zealand and the United States, but Brazil has some interesting insights. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Looking at the phase one agreement, what the U.S. has done is redefine what market access certainty is. There are, give or take, 121 specific concessions that the U.S. got from China in that agreement; 51 of them are what I would call hyper-specific commitments and concessions. They're such things as that, within 20 days of receipt of any monthly updates to the list of U.S. pet food and non-ruminant-derived animal feed facilities that the U.S. has determined to be eligible for export, China shall register the facilities, publish the updates to the list on the Chinese GACC?the Chinese customs website?and allow imports of food derived from animal feed from U.S. facilities on that list. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You have the same thing for pork. You have the same thing for beef. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0These types of market access certainty are the bar. This will essentially have us out of the Chinese market.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If you think about access and what we need to get from China, agriculture offers a possible solution. If we were to engage China and guarantee access to Canadian supply?not that we'll send a certain amount, but that we will not impose political restrictions on China's access to food, on China's access to agricultural technology, on China's ability to invest in or to access agricultural biotechnology, on China's ability to invest in agricultural production, on China's ability to invest in agricultural processing?we'd have the makings, potentially, of an agreement. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This distinguishes us from the Americans, who used food as a political weapon throughout their history. Even just two months ago, a former U.S. undersecretary was threatening to cut off food to North Korea. We distinguish ourselves from the Americans, we establish why we are different and we have the basis for re-engaging China to reset the relation. Obviously, China will want more, but this is a start. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0For the committee?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I'm sure there will be chances to speak some more during the answers to questions.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Before I go to questions, we had Mr. Fragiskatos's motion that I probably should have come to after the break. Is it agreed?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0(Motion agreed to)\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Chair: Thank you very much. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Now we have a six-minute round, Mr. Genuis", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood Park?Fort Saskatchewan, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Tiberghien, I wanted to ask my questions to you. You said some things about the Canada-China relationship that are different from things I've read in other sources, so I thought I would dig in a little bit.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Your colleague, Mr. Evans, suggested that we talk a bit about the relationship between Canadian universities and the Canada-China relationship. When it comes to the Canada-China relationship and the Canada-Huawei relationship, do you have a sense of UBC's financial exposure and how much your institution would stand to lose financially in terms of partnerships if certain things happened that made those partnerships less possible?, \n\xa0\nProf. Yves Tiberghien: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I don't have a sense. I don't manage the overall budget of UBC. What I do know is that when I was director of the institute of Asian research, we had no funding from Chinese sources. We had other endowments that came from Japan, Taiwan and so on, but none from China. The main exposure of UBC is primarily through students?student flows?but students are not just agents of the Chinese state. They are independent members of the middle class, by and large, and they're very hard to control. , \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I appreciate that, and I agree about the important role there, but I've read?and I don't know if you can confirm these figures or not?that at the beginning of 2019, UBC and Huawei alone had partnerships worth $7.6 million over three years, that the exposure on the Vancouver summer program, which was for summer students coming for a month-long period, was about $10 million. Maybe you don't have those numbers offhand. I researched them beforehand, and the level of exposure that UBC has is interesting. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the context of that partnership with Huawei, has CSIS ever issued warnings to you or the university, that you know of, about the risks of collaboration with Huawei?, \n\xa0\nProf. Yves Tiberghien: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Not to me, no. , \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Are you aware of CSIS issuing warnings to other officials at the university?, \n\xa0\nProf. Yves Tiberghien: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mainly from my colleague Paul Evans. He has more contact with CSIS", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0All right. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You mentioned not managing the university's overall budget. Are you still the executive director of the UBC China council?, \n\xa0\nProf. Yves Tiberghien: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You are. Okay.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's interesting that didn't come up in the introduction. My understanding of UBC's China council is that it's a body of administrators and faculty who advise the university on, among other things, how UBC can advance and protect its financial interests vis-a-vis China. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Do you think it's a problem for you to be responsible for working with the university, advising them on their financial interests vis-a-vis China, while also offering expertise to the public on Canada-China relations?, \n\xa0\nProf. Yves Tiberghien: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I need to correct one thing. The China council has no responsibility for financial issues. That is purely managed by the respective vice-presidents and the president. The China council is mostly an advisory group that meets not very often?recently, it's been about twice a year?to review certain broad questions and to have conversations. Then this advice is handed over to the vice-provost, the national and the team.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0At the moment, the role of the China council is actually quite limited", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Let me ask some specific questions about the role.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Do professors on the China council at UBC ever consult with administrators on the council before speaking publicly? Do they ever ask for speaking points before offering public comment?, \n\xa0\nProf. Yves Tiberghien: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0No, and the main reason is that the prime role of a professor in a university is academic freedom', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes', " \n\xa0\nProf. Yves Tiberghien: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When I speak to the media, I don't speak as the China council, and I never mention that title. I speak as a professor of political science who has academic freedom, so those roles are separate, and I keep them very carefully separate", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. Are professors on the China council ever involved in commercial negotiations with Huawei?, \n\xa0\nProf. Yves Tiberghien: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0No. , \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Does the China council play a direct role in university fundraising or in providing advice related to fundraising?, \n\xa0\nProf. Yves Tiberghien: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Not in many years. There were some early discussions, going back five years, but in the last three to five years, there have been no such discussions', " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Are discussions with the China council held about the implications of Canada's China policy on international student recruitment and on university revenue?, \n\xa0\nProf. Yves Tiberghien: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We have had some discussions about trying to have visibility about what could happen with students. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0By the way, I also need to correct something else. In terms of exposure, the Vancouver summer program and Huawei contracts are very different things", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Oh yes, of course. , \n\xa0\nProf. Yves Tiberghien: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Vancouver summer program is under students', " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I understand I didn't mean to conflate those at all, so my apologies if I did. What I meant was to identify those as two very significant examples of multi-million dollar exposure at the university", ' \n\xa0\nProf. Yves Tiberghien: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The bigger exposure is the flow of students. The summer program is a small part. There is a bigger number', " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Because of time, here's my final question. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Would the decisions about the awarding of honorary degrees ever be discussed at the council?, \n\xa0\nProf. Yves Tiberghien: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0No, because the honorary degree decisions are made by the senate. The senate has all prerogatives and is very strict about this", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay, I think that's my time. Thank you", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Mr. Genuis.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Fragiskatos, the floor is yours for six minutes', " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First of all, let me just extend a message of respect to all witnesses, particularly Professor Tiberghien, who had to withstand that line of questioning and did so very calmly. We're very fortunate as a committee to benefit from the insights of witnesses, and today is no different.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Let me begin if I could with Mr. Dade. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Dade, I'm not sure if you were here for the previous testimony, but if you were, you would have heard Charles Burton from the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, who made a statement that I thought was quite interesting and it surprised me. I'd like to get your insight and that of Ms. Sun, as well. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0He said?and I'm paraphrasing?that if Canada wanted to shift its export focus away from China, global commodities could be sold elsewhere, and he implied that this could be done relatively easily. What you've presented to us here in terms of cold, hard data is just how entrenched the relationship is in terms of our economy vis-?-vis China, particularly on agriculture, and the western provinces figure quite prominently in that. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Would it be very easy to just shift quickly, as Mr. Burton implied?, \n\xa0\nMr. Carlo Dade: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for the question. I'll pass along your appreciation for witnesses to the others who preceded us, including the the ambassador.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You would have to pull in the private sector, the trading houses and those who are directly involved to get the definitive answer. Looking at the data and understanding commodity flows, long-term contracts, planting decisions, the massive investments that go to production, the massive investments that go for trade infrastructure, I would submit to you that the answer would probably be no, but I suggest that you call in the experts to get a first-hand confirmation of that. , \n\xa0\nMs. Sharon Zhengyang Sun: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As you can see in the report, we excluded the U.S. in all of our datasets because our trade with the U.S. is still so large, even though we have a mandate for trade diversification. This is because shifting the supply chain is very costly and takes a lot of time. Countries will always be trading with other countries that are larger in economic size and closer in geographic distance. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Trade agreements and institutions that are in place do make a difference, but ultimately it's businesses that trade, so that is what determines the flow. , \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I was also interested, Mr. Dade, when you began your presentation by saying that Canada's relations with China flow through the west. It is, I think it's fair to say, a very underappreciated element of the relationship, just how prominently the western provinces figure in that bilateral.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could you expand on that? I see Mr. Paltiel nodding his head as well, if he wanted to comment", " \n\xa0\nMr. Carlo Dade: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think the data speaks for itself. In addition to the trade relations, you'll note that the western provinces all have on-the-ground representation in China and throughout Asia. I was just in Beijing, and I spent days with the Alberta office and the various staff that the Alberta office has on the ground. Indeed, other provinces?la belle province, bien s?r?but certainly the western provinces are on the ground, and they have deep relations and staff. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's a benefit to the entire country. By working together with the provincial officials, we have greater reach at lower levels of government, and it's an assistance for us. It's an indication, though, as you mentioned, of the importance. , \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I only have two minutes, so if I could, I'll put this to Professor Paltiel and then to Professor Tiberghien.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We heard from Professor Paul Evans in the previous meeting this morning. He recommended a few ways forward for Canada on this relationship we have with China. One suggestion he made was pursuing a strategy of coexistence, as he put it. To quote him, this would involve ?finding ways to live with China? and ?co-operating? where we can on common issues. The former ambassador, Phil Calvert, also said that we ought to find ?specific issues? where we can work ?collectively?.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is there low-hanging fruit that we can identify or that both of you esteemed colleagues can suggest, low-hanging fruit that Canada can reach out and identify so that we can move forward in a meaningful way and perhaps enhance this thaw we're seeing in Canada-China relations right now?, \n\xa0\nDr. Jeremy Paltiel: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Professor Evans mentioned peacekeeping. I think that's an obvious one.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 My colleagues here mentioned that agriculture is one that has been identified for a long time. It's a vital interest in both countries. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On health care, the whole area of health care and long-term care and things having to do with aging in China are non-controversial things that we can work together on", " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Tiberghien, did you want to add to that?, \n\xa0\nProf. Yves Tiberghien: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'll add a couple of things.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 First, we have Bruce Aylward, a Canadian from the WHO who is on the ground in China right now and doing press conferences. Public health is a huge one right now.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Climate change and green tech are enormous. In city management and urban planning, there's enormous progress in China. Then there's the G20, the work around the G20, and the WTO. China is one of the 17 countries that have signed with Canada on the potential short-term fix, or at least the mediation mechanism, to replace the dispute settlement mechanism at the moment", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Bergeron, you have six minutes', " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr.\xa0Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think that all the opinions, all the comments and all the analyses tell us that the Communist Party has taken control of the state apparatus in a very intense and intimate way. There's a close relationship, I would say, between the party apparatus and the state apparatus.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Paltiel, you've carefully pointed out that there's been a paradigm shift with the arrival of the current president, Xi Jinping.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Do you think there is indeed a connection to be made between Xi Jinping's personality and his control of the state and this paradigm shift that is taking place, which has had quite dramatic implications for Canada?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 As you said, can we expect?we don't know when, we don't know how?such a change with a different character at the head of the Chinese state? , \n\xa0\nDr. Jeremy Paltiel: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for your question. I will answer in English.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, Xi Jinping's personality has played a role. I would say that it's a combination of factors?that is to say, China has risen. It has become more powerful. The difficulties that the west saw in the 2008 crisis, the difficulties in the United States and the ongoing problems with wars in the Middle East have given an opportunity to China. Xi Jinping has seized on this.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The other reason is that many Chinese were aware of the fact. This hypothesis that China will eventually converge with the west is not something that is heard only in the west. Many Chinese Communist officials?and I believe Xi Jinping himself?are worried that as China becomes more integrated into the global rules-based system, the Chinese will begin to question whether there's any role or rationale for the Chinese Communist Party. We've seen, since Xi Jinping came to power, a real effort to try to re-emphasize the ideology, role and practices of the Chinese Communist Party.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To the last part of your question, I recently wrote part of a debate on the coronavirus and its effect on Chinese politics. I believe that in some sense Xi Jinping is overstretched; this assertiveness is gone. I can't predict when or how changes will take place in China. It's like predicting earthquakes. We know where the fault lines are, but we don't know when the earthquake is going to happen.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I think that underneath the surface there are some questions about the handling of governance and that these will eventually bubble up, and yes, this will be a part of perhaps a change over time. I did go on the record as thinking that I'm not sure he will serve out a third term. That's my own personal speculation, but it's based on my knowledge of how Chinese Communist processes work", " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Once again, Mr.\xa0Chairman, we have seen that the witnesses had more to say than they could manage in the time allotted to them.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If either of you wish to add to your testimony, you may do so in writing and send it to the clerk for the benefit of this committee.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Quebec Premier Jacques Parizeau used to say that globalization is like the tide: you can't oppose the tide, all you can do is adapt to it. I think we are still in the process of adapting to the effects of globalization, as Professor Tiberghien mentioned a few moments ago.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That said, I was struck by the difference between the testimony of this second group of witnesses and that of the first.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The first group of witnesses seemed to be calling for us to be firmer with China, while the second group was calling for us to work more closely with China. How can we around this table reconcile these seemingly different views between the first group of witnesses we heard and this second slate of witnesses?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is the question addressed to me, Mr.\xa0Bergeron?, \n\xa0\nDr. Jeremy Paltiel: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would say the challenge is adaptation.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We have to adapt ourselves to the new reality of China, and we also have to adapt to the reality of China itself. That's to say that the world has changed, and not just in China. The United States has changed in response to it. We have to adapt to this world. Our traditional policies haven't worked and aren't working. We can't simply rely on our ally to protect us, because our ally has turned its back, in some ways, on the rules-based international order.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We saw in fact that the January 15 agreement is a managed trade agreement. The United States will now be playing a role in which they take unilateral gains from their relationship with China based on their market size, not on the rules-based order. We actually have to work to protect the rules-based order, and our best partner may not be the United States. This is a new world", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Harris', " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you, Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to thank all of the witnesses for bringing forth their perspectives, particularly on the historical dynamics and the change in our relationship over the years. I'd say that all three presentations, including Mr. Dade's, were dependent upon and/or suggesting how we ought to be improving and buttressing the rules-based international order.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In some cases, Mr. Dade, I'll ask you about it specifically, but the question for all of you is this. How do we go about doing that? If we did have a rules-based international order, it might be easier to solve the problems that we have right now with China with respect to human rights or with respect to trade. We've been vulnerable to their taking action against us.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Of course, we've been vulnerable to the United States doing the same thing, but in respect of China, how do we actually achieve that goal? Do you have any suggestions for us lay people who are trying to find solutions to recommend to the government?, \n\xa0\nMr. Carlo Dade: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We'll start.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It relates to the question from Mr. Bergeron. If you look at the data, the data indicates that we are tied to China. The data indicates that in the private sector across Canada individual consumers, businesses, producers and farmers are making a decision that's increasing our trade. When times have been good, trade has been increasing. When times have been bad, trade has been increasing. The question is how we manage that reality. You could have different views as to whether or not that's good, but fundamentally, how do we manage that reality?, \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If I could interrupt, Mr. Dade, given your concerns about certainty in market access, if the trade-off is investment, which I think you actually encourage, how do we avoid further vulnerability, where instead of having the percentage of trade from western Canada in agriculture being beneficial, all of a sudden production is all owned by the Chinese and they're feeding themselves with our land and our resources? How do you avoid that?, \n\xa0\nMr. Carlo Dade: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We haven't seen that elsewhere. I would have you take a look again at the example of Brazil.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 How do we manage this? The rules-based system has been important to Canada and our history. We're facing a time, though, when the U.S. is trying to destroy or undermine the rules-based system, so we have to try to reinforce it with reaching out with like-minded countries or work with Japan. Joining the TPP was the single biggest statement we could make in trying to keep the rules-based order", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you. Can you leave time for Professor Paltiel and...?, \n\xa0\nDr. Jeremy Paltiel: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I was going to echo that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First of all, we have to change our mindset. We are a Pacific nation, but we think like an Atlantic nation, and we have to stop doing that. We have to start thinking like a Pacific nation, which means including the west, and therefore, we have to build on those partnerships of the CPTPP to try to build wider networks, especially in Asia, to project the rules-based order. We should look, as Professor Evans and others have said, towards expanding the CPTPP to include China and other actors so that we can extend the rules-based order. The problem is that it is not likely we will have a bilateral free trade agreement anytime soon, or that one would protect our interests, but we could still work multilaterally through the CPTPP to achieve some of the same ends and to work with the countries involved', " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Can we hear briefly from Professor Tiberghien?, \n\xa0\nProf. Yves Tiberghien: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes. Thank you, Monsieur Harris.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Essentially, my idea would be to differentiate among issues. We cannot take a cookie-cutter approach, a one-size-fits-all approach with China. There are issue areas in which we have to be protective, when it comes to espionage activities and the like or cyber issues. There are issues on which we can work with China, because China is supporting the rules-based order?on the Paris Agreement, on the G20, etc.?and then there are issues on which we need allies to have any leverage. The prime allies should start with Europe and Japan, and then the others. Of course, in other cases, we can work with the U.S. when the U.S. is on board with some dimensions of the rules-based order.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's a differentiated approach for a very complex moment", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Carlo Dade: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It is apparent that the rules-based order has failed. If the Americans continue with this managed trade track, we need to have a plan B to follow the Americans', " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, and I do want to follow up with you, Mr. Dade, because I think it's important. On your suggestion that the model that Mr. Trump and the U.S. have been using with China is one that we should attempt to emulate, I'm wondering how we could manage to do that given the strength of the U.S. market and the tactics that were used to achieve that result. It's not a free trade agreement, obviously. It's a clearly managed trade agreement that excludes Canadian production and some of the elements of that. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0How exactly would Canada achieve a positive result using that sort of approach? What leverage do we have and what percentage?we talked about percentage improvement?of our agricultural trade, for example, is with China?, \n\xa0\nMr. Carlo Dade: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That data is available in what we've handed out. In terms of how we manage this, look, I'm not suggesting we adopt the Trumpian world view, but on the very specific issue of market certainty on agriculture, the Americans have managed to come up with something new. The idea is that we don't have the leverage that the U.S. has, but if we completely flip the script, completely turn it around, the Americans cannot offer the Chinese certainty that America will not use food as a political weapon. We can serve as an example. It's immoral to do so. Canada is a moral country. It's anti-progressive to do so. China will destroy the world if it's going to practise agriculture in ways that aren't at the cutting edge of science and technology", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Part of the knock on China?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Harris', " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0?and a deal with China is that they don't necessarily follow the rules", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Genuis, you have five minutes', " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Fragiskatos doesn't appear to have liked my last line of questioning, but Mr. Tiberghien, this is, I think, an important one to follow up on because I have a couple hundred pages of emails exchanged between members of the China council at UBC over a couple of months in early 2019. Those were obtained under a FOIPPA request in British Columbia. These are important things to highlight, because I asked you if professors on the China council at UBC ever consult with administrators before speaking publicly, and if you ever ask for speaking points before offering public comment. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You said, ?No?, but after receiving an email from a reporter at the UBC student newspaper about Huawei and Canada-China relations on January 18, 2019, you wrote to Adriaan de Jager, associate vice-president of government relations and community engagement, and Murali Chandrashekaran, co-chair of the China council, and you asked, ?Any advice on how I should respond to this request? Thanks Yves?. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Adriaan de Jager responded, ?Looping in Kurt Heinrich who will share our response to media regarding Huawei.? He's a senior director of media relations for UBC. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You replied:\n\n\n\nThanks Adriaan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Kurt: I can of course provide my expertise on the analysis of the larger Huawei event and Canada-China relations. But I will be asked about impact on UBC and UBC's reactions. So, it is good for me to know well the official response...do you encourage me to do this interview?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYves\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Earlier that month, on January 2, you wrote to Paul Evans and others asking for his notes from various meetings. One of the co-chairs of the Canada-China Council?, \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, I didn't raise a point of order during Mr. Genuis's last line of questioning mainly because I thought the witness was doing a very good job of responding to all the questions. However, I believe that in the last round of questioning Mr. Genuis did go well beyond the mandate of this committee into an issue that was not related to the mandate given to us by the House of Commons.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We are to look at the relationship of Canada and China. I don't think the internal workings of one institution are in the particular purview of this committee. I believe it's amounting to both an attack on a person who is a witness and has graciously given us his time and on an institution that has its own priorities.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I am concerned that we are veering beyond?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Oliphant, I think this....\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Look, I do remind members to stick to the mandate. However, I think this is primarily debate?, \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, if I could just speak to the point of order before my?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I'd like to have you go on with your questions, if you don't mind, in terms of time for all members", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This is a question of the integrity of our research and the advice we are receiving, and it is very telling that Mr. Oliphant is uncomfortable with these questions.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm reading from an internal email in which one of the co-chairs of the China council wrote?, \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have another point of order", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0More points of order...? Mr. Oliphant is very uncomfortable', " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On a point of order, I would like to know what it is telling of, because indirectly this?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm sorry. This is debate. You're getting into debate, Mr. Oliphant. I appreciate?, \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Then it's a point of privilege, not a point of order.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On a point of privilege, not on a point of order, I would argue that the member is impugning my character by saying that something is ?telling? of what I am doing when I am simply trying to raise a point of order.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0For me, that's a point of privilege, not a point of order. If the member has an accusation he is wanting to make, he should make it but not impugn my character", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Oliphant.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm going to go back to Mr. Genuis", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair, and again, very revealing.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The email references an official UBC point of view: \n\n\n\nI would recommend we have one meeting in which all players are present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYves?you should trigger that meeting sooner rather than later....?\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You wrote back saying, ?I just sent the general email triggering the message.?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Another question I asked of you is if professors on the China council are involved in commercial negotiations with Huawei. You said no. I have here an email you received from Paul Evans on on March 9. It reads as follows: \n\n\n\nMeigan set up a very good session for me on Wednesday with six of her...applied science colleagues. Crisp and informed discussion about experiences in working with China, Huawei related matters in particular, and the changing environment for future collaborations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReconciling national security concerns and related risks with advancing research and science is a complicated issue that they are all thinking about. So far there has been no interaction with Ottawa on this but clearly an interest in doing so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've suggested a second meeting with the same or a slightly enlarged group or the smaller UBC group (four of five were with us) negotiating with HW now. Meigan made the case that this is an issue where UBC could play a national leadership role. She'll do some internal consultations. Gail has informed.\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I had asked you as well if the China council played a direct role in university fundraising or in providing advice related to fundraising. You said not in many years.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On March 20, 2019, you sent an email to various colleagues called ?Strategic follow-up action items UBC-China? in which one of the items is the presidential advisory council on China. About this advisory council, you said that Jack Austin, one of the co-chairs of the China council, remained very excited about this process and thought that it held the key to a higher quality relation of UBC with China, but also to fundraising related to China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The minutes from the September 12, 2018, meeting of the China council say, ?Community engagement and PACC: to complete the President's Advisory Council on China...to incorporate top...societal leaders (and future fundraisers), as this could have tremendous impact in terms of the university's reputation, networks, and fundraising.? \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I asked if decisions about awarding honorary degrees were discussed at the council. You said no, but according to the agenda for January 18, 2019, UBC awarded an honorary degree to Kevin Rudd, former prime minister of Australia.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I asked if CSIS had issued warnings about the risks of collaboration with Huawei. You said, not that you were aware of, but on January 22 of last year Paul Evans wrote to you and said, ?CSIS has issued warnings already about the risks of research and other collaboration with Huawei in particular.?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, I'd like to, in light of this, give notice of the following motion:\n\n\n\n That the Committee undertake a study of no fewer than four meetings into the relationship between Canadian Universities and Chinese government-controlled entities, and that as part of that study the committee hear from the Co-Chairs of the UBC China Council, and that the Committee report its findings to the House.\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This is a notice of motion. I'm not moving the motion, just providing the verbal notice of motion", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you very much, Mr. Genuis.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I will explain to the witnesses that members have the right to use their five-minute period in any way they wish. They can make comments, as Mr. Genius did after his first question, or they can ask questions. I would encourage members, if they ask questions, to allow reasonable time for witnesses to respond and therefore not to ask questions at the end.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The next speaker is Mr.\xa0Dubourg.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You have five minutes', ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Chair', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Bergeron, are you raising a point of order?, \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I understand what you've just explained very well and I totally agree", " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0However, given the nature of Mr.\xa0Genius' remarks, Mr.\xa0Tiberghien should be given an opportunity, at least as a courtesy, to respond and explain his point of view", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Mr. Bergeron. However, I will leave it up to the other members to give a portion of their time to do that, if they wish.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mr. Dubourg, you have the floor', " \n\xa0\nMr. Emmanuel Dubourg (Bourassa, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Mr.\xa0Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 First of all, I'd like to acknowledge all the witnesses who are here and thank them for their presentations.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Our relationship with China is at an impasse. It is a difficult situation and your expertise, gentlemen, is extremely important to us so that we can see how to improve this relationship.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Tiberghien, I want to give you time to answer, if you have a comment to make following this long statement.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The floor is yours. , \n\xa0\nProf. Yves Tiberghien: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr.\xa0Dubourg.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Of course, I'd like to answer. It's an important matter.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to first thank the member for those questions.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to preface by saying this is really taken out of context. This is picking one little thing out of a hundred others, so you pick a lot of noise. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First, it is not representative of the usual function. Out of 200 interviews I may have given in three years, this one may be the one where I asked for some thoughts, but I received none and I spoke freely afterwards. You must put this in a larger context. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Second, I did say that I had not heard directly from CSIS, but that I had heard from Paul Evans. This is exactly what you find in the emails.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Third, when it comes to the PAC, the presidential advisory council, this is an old idea that goes back to 2014 or 2015. It has been kicked around in the council, but so far, it has led to nothing. Nothing came out of it. Primarily, the idea was to create an advisory group. It's not primarily about fundraising. You picked a little bit of noise here, but we have to look at the primary goal.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I also want to make it clear that the China council played a role in, for example, convincing the president not to have a Confucius Institute at UBC. We did the research. We did interviews with government, and found that this was risky. We pushed back and we advised against having it. We played a role in ensuring the Dalai Lama came to UBC. We are very neutral. We are pretty happy and are very proud of the role we play in hearing all sides. It's very important to state that the elements picked up here were not representative.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There was a discussion, as noted in the emails, about Huawei that was triggered by the hearings with Paul Evans in Ottawa. They were hearings at GAC, not at CSIS, where we heard there were concerns in Ottawa so we did trigger the meeting. The issue was not about managing media. It was about responding to what we heard from government. We had a very fair discussion. We decided to monitor, to watch what was happening and to be very careful.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Also, one consequence of that was that the officer in charge, the vice-president of research, Gail Murphy, went to Ottawa and was briefed. She did it not as a China council member but as vice-president of research, so she is the lead person managing that", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Emmanuel Dubourg: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr.\xa0Tiberghien.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Since we\'re talking about Huawei, my next question will be for Mr.\xa0Paltiel.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I know that in June 2019 there was a meeting to discuss difficulties and solutions. You organized a summit and a conference.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0One of the key questions addressed was ?The fate of Huawei and Canada\'s next generation 5G communications network. How do we arrive at the right decision?"[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You know the background related to Ms. Meng Wanzhou. In your opinion, should we make a decision on Huawei now or should we wait?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Finally, what impact would one decision or another regarding Huawei have on our relationship with the Group of Five?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You have thirty seconds left', " \n\xa0\nDr. Jeremy Paltiel: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On the question of Huawei, I have some complex views. I can't do them in one second. The point is that this is an issue of security, yes. I'm also on record as saying that research partnerships with universities should also be subject to some security concerns. The problem of Huawei is also a problem of competitiveness and technology development and investment in Canada. We have to take a look at the Huawei issue from the perspective of what it means?if we start banning particular companies in particular countries?to the whole notion of national treatment in international trade. That's a problem", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm sorry. The time is up.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Genuis, you have five minutes", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Professor Tiberghien, I want to give you most of this round to respond to whatever you want to respond to. In fairness, I asked you questions in the first round, and in the second round I simply shared emails that seemed to suggest a somewhat different interpretation of the facts.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You said, in response to my colleague's question just now, that in this rare instance on January 18 when you asked Mr. de Jager if he encouraged you to do the interview.... You seemed to imply that there was no response. In fact, there was a response. That email was sent on the Friday. On the Monday, there was a response that said, ?Good morning, Yves. Thanks for the note. Please see below for UBC's position on research agreements with Huawei. I hope this helps.?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Then it contains what looks like five or six paragraphs of bold type. That's there. That's part of the record. I would welcome members and members of the public to take a look at these emails because they raise concerns for me about about the fact that we have not one but two people today who are coming to us as experts who are involved in this Canada?China council.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's a minute and a half, but you have three and a half minutes left of my round to address whatever you like and use how you see fit", " \n\xa0\nProf. Yves Tiberghien: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Genuis, for the time.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Obviously, I haven't prepared for this. I haven't looked back at all the emails. I have 300 to 400 a day. Thank you for correcting my memory on this. My recollection is that.... I often meet the UBC student newspaper because they are often my students.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As far as I recollect, whatever the formal facts given by Mr. de Jager, they may not have popped up in a discussion. I can't recall. I will have to check. As far as I know, most of my interviews with student papers are pretty broad discussions. They want to know what's happening, the views on both sides, etc. Usually, I'm very frank. I've often been very open and frank. I can look back at whether this was used in an interview. It may not have been even used. I don't recall. It was not very striking. I want to say again that those are....\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The emails in January 2019 follow conversations in Ottawa by Paul Evans?for me, it was with GAC?where we heard for the first time that there was concern in Ottawa. I guess the professional thing that we did with UBC in the end was to hold a conversation where, for the first time, there was discussion that involved some deans and the vice-president, etc. It was a professional thing to do, to hear what we heard from Ottawa. That was the bulk of it", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Tiberghien.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I really feel that this is an area where we need to have further study at the committee. We've talked about a few examples of the financial exposure. Clearly, the financial exposure is coming up in conversations with the China council. We've identified two small examples?likely small in the scheme of things?that total $17 million for one Canadian university in terms of exposure.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have about a minute left, but I'll turn that over to Mr. Albas", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Genuis, Mr. Chair, and all of our witnesses.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I am also concerned. I know Waterloo university has publicly asked for clarification on who it can contract with, particularly when they are concerned about certain corporations. In this case, I'm sure one of them would be Huawei, although I can't be certain. However, there's a lot of clarity that is being asked for by Canadian universities.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would like to go to the Canada West Foundation now. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You said that the growth that Canada has seen over past years in selling our agriculture, for example, to China, has gone up and up. You have suggested that perhaps some sort of deal could be made.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think that would be subject to the new NAFTA provisions, and I think we also need to understand what this U.S.-China managed trade agreement will do to our own exports. It's very difficult to foresee that there are not going to be major structural changes in flows in the North American-Chinese trade balance. Those things will harm Canadian agriculture.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could you please...?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It will have to be a comment rather than a question, because your time is up.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Now we have?, \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Chair, may I suggest that in our remaining time, we will take maybe two minutes and then offer it to the opposition, the third and fourth parties, if that works for our time?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's very helpful. Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Zann, please", " \n\xa0\nMs. Lenore Zann: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First of all I want to say thank you again to all of the witnesses. I want to apologize if anybody has been made to feel uncomfortable. I think sometimes these little moments of ?gotcha? are very unpleasant and really unprofessional.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On that note, though, I would love to ask Mr. Tiberghien a question. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Having spent time in Hong Kong doing research, and having given lectures in China on global governance, what do you think of the current state of affairs in Hong Kong and how it's going to evolve? What are the reactions and attitudes of students in China toward that topic and also global governance?, \n\xa0\nProf. Yves Tiberghien: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much for this great question, Madam Zann.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First, on global governance, that's an easy one. When I give lectures at universities in China, I'm struck that there is a lot of interest and enthusiasm about the idea of global governance or global public good. You can find a young class, at this moment in history, and they believe in a rules-based order on the economic and environmental side. There is a lot of interest in the UN, in the SDGs, in climate change. It is quite similar to what you see in Europe, or to some extent, in places like Japan or Korea and Canada.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to put this on the table. When I get to discuss the political situation, usually they aspire for more freedom and fixing problems in China, but they do it in a way that's humbled by history. They want to find a pathway that's not going to destroy China like it has in the past. There is that awareness as well.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When it comes to Hong Kong, I feel a bit of a sense of tragedy. I feel sad. I have a lot of friends in Hong Kong. I was there in 1996 and 1997. I did months of interviews. When I was at Stanford in a legal and a co-operation centre?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I'm sorry, Mr.\xa0Tiberghien, but your two minutes are up.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I must now give the floor to Mr.\xa0Bergeron, who has two minutes and thirty seconds", " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'll try to be brief to give our witnesses some time.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I ended my last round of questions with a question that I thought was highly relevant, especially since it is the kind of question that our public servants are not able to answer objectively. It's not that they don't have the competence to do so, but, in any event, I think we're beginning to understand that there are changes to be made in Canada's foreign policy, particularly with respect to China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The question I asked the previous witnesses is this: do you believe that Canada is currently well equipped to take full measure of the changes that are taking place and to adapt to them?, \n\xa0\nDr. Jeremy Paltiel: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0May I start?, \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Why not?, \n\xa0\nDr. Jeremy Paltiel: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have advocated for some time that we need more co-operation with people who are facing the same circumstances. We can't deal with China alone. Our traditional way of dealing with it is that our alliance goes straight to the United States. The American alliances in Asia are also bilateralized. There is no framework that we could, and should, use to talk with like-minded countries, if we want to call it that?South Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand?where we can compare notes on not just dealing with China, but also dealing with their allies and the relationship between them.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We need a structure for this, so that we can be on the same page and be able to approach China collectively, because individually, we do not have the leverage. Of course, Europe is also important, but Europe has its own issues and problems", " \n\xa0\nMr. Carlo Dade: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Canada must increase its capability.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We don't have the research institutions, the non-academic think tanks, that can engage on an ongoing basis. This is a critical weakness, when you look at Australia or the U.S", " though it's difficult when we stray from the practicalities and go into political grandstanding and into attacking organizations that have worked hard to help Canada and have worked hard to increase our capacity and understanding.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You hear time and again that we simply don't have the capacity. What we had here today kind of diminishes our ability to get capacity", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Harris, you have two and a half minutes', " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First of all, Professor Paltiel, you talked about Huawei. I'm interested. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I gather from what you're saying that you believe that Canada should take an independent view and decision with respect to Huawei, and it should include business aspects to it as well as security.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Are you suggesting that we should seriously consider an approach that's similar to what the U.K. has taken in terms of recognizing the security issues with respect to certain aspects of the 5G network, but that there are business aspects in which there can be participation? Is that your position?, \n\xa0\nDr. Jeremy Paltiel: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That is my position. I put in my remarks, but didn't get to it, that we should take an empirical approach to security issues. That's what the British have done. That's what Canada has done in the past. We have to be mindful of our senior ally. We also have to be mindful of the risks. We also have to be mindful, if we want to have an open climate for investment and also the creation of intellectual property in Canada, that much of the 5G technology that Huawei has developed came from Canadian scientists, scientists in Ottawa.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Are we going to be able to enjoy the benefits of the creation of intellectual property created here in Canada? That's a question both for regulation and for universities, but it's also a question of how we deal with this 5G network issue", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The second question has to do with increased trade with China with less than absolute market access. Are we making ourselves more vulnerable by being dependent on that trade in the absence of a rules-based system that guarantees they'll actually following those rules? The knock on the idea of a trade agreement with China?and some celebrated the fact that it failed?was that we would be bound by the rules through our legal system but they would not. Is that a concern? \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Should we be getting that certainty first?, \n\xa0\nDr. Jeremy Paltiel: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0China is a member of the WTO. It's subject to more anti-dumping provisions than any other country. The dispute mechanism of the WTO is not working because the United States refuses to name judges to it. That's a problem that has to be dealt with. China actually acts in many ways within the rules of the WTO. We do need the WTO. We do need to be on that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The premise of your question is a little strange in some sense. Either we're a trading nation or we're not. When you're a trading nation, you're, in that sense, automatically vulnerable to changes in trade flows. Unless we decide to go the way of North Korea to autarky, we have no choice but to be subject to those vulnerabilities", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you. That answers the question', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Harris.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you to all the witnesses. We very much appreciate your presence here, whether directly or remotely.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The meeting is adjourned.]']
["[\n\xa0\nThe Chair (Hon. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.)): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 This meeting of the Special Committee on Canada-China Relations is called to order. We're now in the public part of the meeting.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Williamson has a motion", ' \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson (New Brunswick Southwest, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair. I appreciate it. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for starting a few minutes early. I really do not want to take a lot of time away from our witnesses today.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Other members of the committee likely received last week the motion that I am putting forward for consideration this morning. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is it common to read out the motion?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes', " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I move the following:\n\n\n\nThat the committee express its grave concern over the arrest of Jimmy Lai Chee-ying, Lee Cheuk-yan and Yeung Sum in Hong Kong, and that this be reported to the House.\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To give you a little background, 22 years ago I started working for the National Post newspapers. As we were launching the paper, I had a brief conversation with Conrad Black, who was then residing in London. Mr. Black told me and others that he was coming from the most dynamic news market in the world, that being London, England. I took a moment to correct him and said, ?Actually, no. In my opinion, the most dynamic news market in the world is Hong Kong.? \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Jimmy Lai is the founder of the Apple Daily newspaper. He's a contributor to the Wall Street Journal. It is deeply concerning that he and two former lawmakers in the special administrative region of Hong Kong were recently arrested. I think this does warrant special consideration by the Parliament of Canada. I don't know if members have had a chance to go over the stories around the detention and arrest here. It is the motivation for my motion to raise this.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The challenge here is that the People's Republic of China agreed to fulfill the basic law, and the position of the Government of Canada is not to force upon China obligations that it did not agree to 23 years ago but to fulfill those obligations. Those obligations were to allow the special administrative region of Hong Kong to continue with its system of government, which allows for the free expression and free assembly rights that we hold dear in this country.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'll pause there, Mr. Chairman, and hopefully move it to a vote", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Oliphant', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant (Don Valley West, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As I said in the House on Friday, when the member for Steveston asked a question and as parliamentary secretary I responded, I hope everyone in the House shares the concern about this arrest. We accept the motion, and we would be happy to have a vote on it right away', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We will go to the vote.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0(Motion agreed to)\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Chair: Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Now we'll proceed to the witnesses.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We have today, as an individual, Mr. Howard Balloch, former Canadian ambassador to the People's Republic of China.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We also welcome Mr.\xa0Guy Saint-Jacques, former Canadian ambassador to the People's Republic of China.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Balloch, would you like to begin, please? You have 10 minutes", " \n\xa0\nMr. Howard Balloch (Former Ambassador of Canada to the People's Republic of China, As an Individual): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's an honour to appear before this committee today.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In listening to some of the deliberations of this committee and the witnesses from whom you have already heard, I note three occasionally recurrent and, in my view, fallacious premises.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First is the premise that China is a frozen-in-time singularity, a monolithic, ideologically driven, unchanging country.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Second is the premise that the policy of broad and fulsome engagement has failed and that it was principally and naively aimed at changing China internally. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Third is the premise that there is out there somewhere, simply waiting to be formulated, a comprehensive and coherent new ?China policy? to serve as a course correction for all of Canada's involvement with this huge and enormously complex China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Before I say a little about each of these, here is a word on the historical context. When Xi Jinping came to power, there was initially no indication that he would divert China from its 35-year-long road of domestic reform and international co-operation and convergence. But in spite of early reformist indications, in 2014 he launched a comprehensive counter-reform agenda. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0He announced the ?made in China 2025? program to indigenize and dominate key economic sectors. He reversed SOE reform, halted social and legal reform, suppressed freedom of expression and religious tolerance, especially in Muslim areas, reinforced the great Chinese firewall and greatly expanded state control of the media and the Internet. The aims were clear: to reverse the decline of the party and the state, restore national ideological purity, overcome China's technological subservience to the west and reassert China's role on the global stage. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In addressing the first of the three premises, I would remind that China today is not the China of 1959 or 1966, nor is Xi Jinping Stalin or Kim Jong-un. There is no doubt that he has centralized power to an extent not known since Mao Zedong, and that the Communist Party and the Chinese state speak with a single aggressive voice, accompanied by actions that sometimes border on the brutish, as Canada has regrettably learned. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yet Xi Jinping and the party leadership know that to govern, they need the support of both the population and a broad range of elites. While the state speaks internationally with a single and unyielding voice, there is a broader array of views and voices among the Chinese elites whose support is necessary to Xi's rule. I personally hear unhappiness among both reformist state and private sector business leaders, and we all hear of push-back in academic circles and among young stars of film and television, and Internet influencers. Throughout all these communities, as well as in think tanks and in progressive internationalist corners of the state bureaucracy, there are many who regret the growing anti-China sentiment abroad and who dislike watching their country leaving the gradualist paths of increased institutionalization of the rule of law and a co-operative foreign policy. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The lack of democratic elections in China does not mean that effective feedback loops do not exist. If I have learned anything about China during some 45 years of observation and 20 years of living there, it's that China is in constant evolution. Whenever I have assumed stasis for the status quo or that voices calling for change have been permanently sidelined, I have inevitably been proven wrong. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As to the second premise, I would like to dispute that the general policy of engagement with China has failed. Indeed, the widespread and more or less continuous Canadian consensus around a robust engagement with China has brought economic benefits across the breadth and depth of Canada, but it has also helped China improve its food security, become more effective in the fight against international crime, and engage co-operatively on environmental matters and in global efforts to deal with climate change. \xa0\xa0(1005)\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It has unquestionably led to a generally co-operative China in multinational institutions, more rules-based behaviour in international trade and economic matters, better respect?not perfect, but better?for intellectual property, and a practice of accepting the rulings of the WTO, unlike the case with some other countries.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It has also resulted in Canadians from a vast array of professions, pursuits and backgrounds building wide-ranging relationships with Chinese counterparts, giving us a collective understanding of, and influence in, government circles and with the leaders of business, academic, and artistic and sports communities. It has produced a very broadly supported positive image of Canada and Canadians among the general Chinese citizenry.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Engagement has always been principally aimed at serving Canadian interests, and only indirectly at encouraging systemic internal change in China. Engagement does not mean making friction-free or good relations the priority. It means playing with a full team of talented players, not playing with an empty net. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We can and do welcome Chinese investment, making sure that the rules we establish for corporate behaviour are strictly followed. When matters of national security are at stake, we can and should use our formidable capabilities and intelligence to determine ourselves whether and how the activities of Chinese companies should be fenced off and limited.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We can and must play defence when required, making clear that there are lines that should not be crossed, lines that need to be defended when Canadians are mistreated in China, when we see misbehaviour on Canadian campuses, when we find interference and even extortion in the Canadian-Chinese communities, or when there is abuse of our unreciprocated press and media openness.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In spite of those who argue for a shift to some sort of containment policy?perhaps encouraged by our friends to the south, who seem genetically programmed to divide the world between friends and enemies?choosing not to engage with China is not a rational option. As it is increasingly internationalist, one of the world's two largest economies, China impacts our interests everywhere: in global capital flows, international financial stability, critical supply chains, and globalizing epidemics. In all matters impacting the earth's commons, from climate change to illegal drug trades and international financial crime, China is and will remain an essential world player.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That Canadians in every walk of life have developed relationships of exchange, trust and influence with Chinese counterparts, who in turn can influence their country's behaviour in their respective areas, is vital to the promotion and protection of real and long-term Canadian interests.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Finally, the fallacy of the third premise is evident from that of the first two. The promotion and protection of Canadian interests and values, which is what foreign policy is, cannot be reduced to a simplistic China policy, as some have suggested. If I were to propose that we should have a new United States policy, you would dismiss me as a simpleton. Canadian interests in and relationships with our neighbour to the south are far too deep and varied to be corralled into a simplistic framework. We have learned that not only does our government need to pursue a close and influential relationship with the administration in Washington but also our country needs to have a vast network of other relationships with congressional, regional, municipal, business, academic and other American leaders. We do not allow the pursuit and protection of our interests in the United States to be derailed by a change in national government, by an unwanted departure from past policies or commitments, or by the particular if not peculiar pronouncements of a leader we have no influence in choosing.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We know that turning our backs on the positive and potential in our transborder relationship is not an option. When challenged, we gear up, not down. We would do well to approach China in the same way.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chairman", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Mr. Balloch.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Saint-Jacques', " \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques (Former Ambassador of Canada to the People's Republic of China, As an Individual): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for the invitation, Mr.\xa0Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I am a career diplomat, having spent 39\xa0years with Global Affairs Canada, including 13\xa0years in China: 2\xa0years in Hong Kong and 11\xa0years in Beijing. I was an ambassador for the last four years of that period, from 2012\xa0to\xa02016.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Today, I would like to discuss three topics: the state of bilateral relations, China under Xi Jinping and, finally, the adjustments required, in my view, to Canada's engagement strategy with China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Before we get started, let me give you some of my main messages. This committee provides an opportunity not only to take stock of the bilateral relationship, but also to adjust Canada's engagement strategy towards China.\xa0\xa0(1010)\xa0\xa0\n\n[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It has become very difficult to remain ambivalent on China after having been victims of their brutal retaliatory measures following the arrest of Mrs. Meng Wanzhou and also knowing how they interfere in Hong Kong and the treatment given to Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Colin Robertson pointed out the following in the Globe and Mail last July:\n\n\n\nWe need a realistic, not a romantic, China policy. It should start with the recognition that China is an authoritarian state, a strategic competitor and systemic rival. It will never follow Western democratic norms because that would destabilize the Communist Party?the root and base of the People?s Republic of China. \n\n\nAs a result, we have to review our engagement strategy with China and base our approach on the protection of our values and on reciprocity. It also means diversifying our trade to other countries in Asia. As well, we need to work with partners to reinforce the multilateral system. Domestically, we need to react strongly to any interference attempt by the Chinese Communist Party or the Chinese government. Similar to Australia, we need to adopt laws to prevent such interference. Finally, we need to continue to develop our competencies to better understand China, as it is not going away.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Let me turn to bilateral relations. As you know, all official dialogue is suspended. There are very few and limited official contacts. Fifteen months into the crisis, what has been the impact of the strategy pursued by the Canadian government so far? While Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have finally had access to a lawyer, there is some uncertainty as to where the legal process stands for them. Their trial could be announced any day. If so, it will take 18 to 24 months before they are sentenced. Once the process starts, it will become a lot more difficult to get them out. I lived through that with Kevin and Julia Garratt. Plus, we have no word from the Chinese supreme court on the appeal of Robert Schellenberg's death sentence. China has warned us that there will be no improvement in the relationship until Mrs. Meng Wanzhou is freed. Unless the judge decides in June that Meng?s rights were not respected when she was arrested, and she is then released, her extradition process will drag on for years.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On the trade front, our exports last year to China dropped 16%, or $4.5 billion, and will likely drop further this year because of the impact of COVID-19 and the trade deal between China and the U.S.A. Plus, we could be subject to further measures if the government decides that Huawei will not participate in 5G development in Canada. In summary, we have to brace ourselves for years of difficult relations.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Howard spoke about China under Xi Jinping. I will summarize my comments here, because I agree with all he said on Xi Jinping. This crisis shows the challenges of dealing with a superpower that ignores international rules when they are not to its liking and does not hesitate to severely punish countries that refuse to obey its diktats. While Canada is not the first country to be at the receiving end of China?s displeasure, it is the first time where a country has rallied support from allies. In fact, this also illustrates how China has become a lot more assertive, aggressive and, I would say, arrogant since Xi Jinping took control of the Communist Party in November 2012. Of course, the ongoing crisis related to COVID-19 is having a very severe impact on the Chinese economy. It comes after a difficult 2019 for Xi Jinping, with the situation in Hong Kong not resolved, electoral results not to his liking in Taiwan, the trade war with the U.S", " which has slowed down the Chinese economy, and the African swine flu epidemic.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It also makes it almost impossible to meet two of his goals?namely, eliminating poverty this year and China becoming a comprehensively well-off society. For that, he needs growth of at least 5.6%, and I think it's likely to be around 4% to 5%. While there is a lot of popular discontent, I don't think the Xi leadership is under threat. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This leads me to my third point and the key question for Canada and other western countries: Is it possible to have normal relations with China? I would argue that despite the ongoing problems that could mar the relationship for years, we have to look at where we want to be 10 years from now. Despite the slowdown of its economy, and especially the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, China can continue to grow at 4% to 6% for many years. I base this on its urbanization rate, which is still low at about 59%, and its plan to move to an economy where growth will be based on consumption and services. Of course, debt has to be watched. It stands now at about 300% of GDP. All of this is to say that China will remain an important market for Canadian exporters.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In my view, there are a number of measures the government could take, both bilaterally and multilaterally. On the bilateral side, as a starting point we should define our fundamental values and interests. Therefore, there should be no tolerance for freelancing by Chinese investigators in Canada to repatriate economic fugitives and no tolerance for interference in Canadian politics, on Canadian campuses, and in the Canadian Chinese community. As I mentioned earlier, I encourage you to look at the four laws adopted by Australia to prevent interference in its internal affairs. There should be no tolerance for spying by the Chinese government or the People's Liberation Army to gain a commercial advantage. In fact, we should expel Chinese spies when they are discovered, or charge perpetrators of espionage.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As well, I think we should announce that we will no longer pursue a free trade agreement with China. We should launch a special review of an ongoing collaboration on artificial intelligence. This would be to try to ensure that Canadian technology is not used to put in place the social credit system in China. Also, we should look at the bilateral investment treaty to see if changes are required. We should conduct more rigorous and sustained inspections of Chinese products to ensure they satisfy our safety standards. We should announce that we will redeploy trade commissioners to other countries in Asia and take advantage of free trade agreements while looking at ways to better support companies in China. In my view, we should apply reciprocity in terms of Chinese government access in Ottawa to make it similar to what Ambassador Barton has in Beijing. What I have in mind is that no federal minister should accept an invitation to lunch or dinner at the Chinese embassy.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As Howard said, we have to continue to work with China on global issues, such as climate change?months ago, in fact, I was thinking about pandemics, and now we are in the middle of one?economic issues and nuclear proliferation. There are many areas in which Canada can offer a lot to China. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Huawei has been discussed a lot. I worked on this issue when I was ambassador. I think we should open the 5G process to all public companies and adopt a position similar to that of the United Kingdom. So far, the approach pursued by CSE, whereby all equipment is tested before being deployed in Canada, has worked. Again, the government, and business for that matter, will have to increase their capacity to understand China better and to ensure a well-informed and more sophisticated approach to China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On the multilateral front, clearly Canada is not in a position to criticize China much by itself on its trade practices or human rights. We must recognize that our capacity to influence is very limited. As China is concerned about its international reputation, we should continue to seek support from allies, including in Asia from Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and Singapore, to d?marche the Chinese government to release our prisoners, but we should also think about developing a strategy to join efforts on issues of common concern in order to prevent China from punishing another country that does something that displeases it. We should also make joint d?marches in Beijing on the situation in Xinjiang or human rights abuses and call on China to respect its own constitution and improve the way it administers justice. This is also important to reassure foreign investors.\xa0\xa0(1015)\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We should also look at ways to better support democracy in Hong Kong and Taiwan. We should work also with allies on common approaches to Chinese opposition of foreign technology and investment in general, on ensuring that China delivers on the promises it made when it joined the WTO, and on pushing for the respect of international norms, so as to ensure that the multilateral system works and is not undermined, and that obligations apply to all.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In conclusion, as Kurt Campbell and Jake Sullivan pointed out in the September edition of Foreign Affairs:\n\n\nThe best defence of democracy is to stress the values that are essential to good governance, especially transparency and accountability, and to support civil society, independent media, and the free flow of information. \n\n\n\xa0\xa0(1020)\xa0\xa0\n\n[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for your attention. I will be happy to answer your questions", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Mr.\xa0Saint-Jacques.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We now go to the first round of questions or comments by members, a six-minute round. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Genuis', " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood Park?Fort Saskatchewan, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to thank both of you, not only for your testimony today but for your service to Canada.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to start with Ambassador Saint-Jacques. Sir, you mentioned the Garratt case, which is, of course, of great interest to this committee. The Garratts were released, and of course, we're hoping for a similar outcome in the present cases. I wonder if you could share a little bit, briefly, about what led to success in the context of the Garratt case", " \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Well, it started in a similar fashion, inasmuch as we had received a request from the U.S. to extradite Mr. Su Bin, who was a Chinese person living in Vancouver and who was wanted for spying activities. A week later, unfortunately, Kevin and Julia Garratt were arrested. We went through a very similar process whereby we couldn't have access to them during the interrogation phase. We knew that they were detained in a location near Dandong. Finally, after a lot of pressure we were able to have consular access, but they didn't have access to their lawyers.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What changed was that, contrary to the Chinese government's expectations, Mr. Su Bin made a deal with American authorities, agreed to a plea bargain, and therefore waived his rights and was extradited rapidly to the U.S. In the meantime, the legal process for Mr. Garratt started. In the Chinese system, once you are formally charged, you are found guilty 99.9% of the time, so it was just a matter of time.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This started back in August 2014. It was under the previous government. Despite all attempts by Minister Baird and by the Prime Minister?Mr. Harper also raised the issue of the Garratts with the Chinese leadership?and despite pleas by the then Governor General Mr. Johnston, there was no success. Finally, when Prime Minister Trudeau made his first visit to China at the end of August, we used this to negotiate a way out. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In fact, the Chinese government was angry every time a Canadian leader would raise high-profile consular cases in bilateral meetings, so they insisted on creating a new dialogue. We had a whole slew of dialogues. This one would be on national security, and they said it would be the one in which we could discuss high-profile consular cases. We said we would agree to the creation of this committee, provided it would be named the national security and rule of law dialogue.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0They also wanted to discuss an extradition treaty. We kept telling them we were not going to negotiate an extradition treaty that would never be able to meet our standards, but I saw this as a good opportunity to discuss how law works in Canada. The first meeting of that committee took place in September 2016, two weeks after the visit of Mr. Trudeau. That's where we were able to negotiate. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Chinese completed the trial. They sentenced Mr. Garratt and then agreed to expel him", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Just to follow up on that, in Jonathan Manthorpe's famous book Claws of the Panda, he wrote this about this case, which is similar to what you said:\n\n\n\nThe price of Garratt?s release appears to have been an extradition treaty. Ottawa soon issued a communiqu?: ?The two sides determined that the short-term objectives for Canada-China co-operation on security and rule of law are to start discussions on an Extradition Treaty and a Transfer of Offenders Treaty as well as other related matters.?\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You used the term ?negotiate? the release. In August, Bill Morneau was in China, and it was at that time when he announced Canada's desire to enter the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. We have the implication in Mr. Manthorpe's book that there was a sort of quid pro quo around the beginning of those extradition discussions and the release of the Garratts. Is this what you mean by negotiation? Was there some kind of quid pro quo here?, \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Well, with all due respect to Mr. Manthorpe, he is wrong on this, because I was closely involved in all of these discussions. Again, we were very clear with the Chinese. We agreed to discuss an extradition treaty, and again, it was in a way to try to make them improve the way they administer their own justice. We were telling them that the way the proof was put together would not stand the light of day in Canadian courts. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Therefore, this was totally separate from other issues. This was, of course, a very important issue for the Canadian government to get the release of Kevin Garratt. At that time, Mrs. Garratt herself had been released on bail, which I had to sign for. In my view, the decision on whether to join the Asian Investment Infrastructure Bank was totally separate. It?, \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Can I just ask a quick question? It wasn't perceived as a quid pro quo in your mind. Is there a possibility that this was interpreted on the Chinese side as involving some kind of quid pro quo around some of these policy decisions that were taken at the same time, or in the same visits, that the Garratt issue was discussed?, \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There was no quid pro quo, in my view. I think it was very clear. We had many discussions with the Chinese, and we always outlined the view of Canadians that they saw the arrest of Kevin and Julia Garratt as outrageous and that this had to be resolved before the relationship could move forward. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Fragiskatos. , \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos (London North Centre, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This is the third or fourth time my friend Mr. Genuis has brought up or referred to matters of extradition. I know we have witnesses here, and I certainly have questions for them, but I think it's important, for his knowledge and for the committee's knowledge, to put things into context. I was able to dig up some information?before I am perhaps accused of bias by my colleague, it comes from the National Post?that under the previous Conservative government, 330 individuals were returned to China from Canada. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To quote from the article, ?Documents obtained with an access to information request show prime minister Stephen Harper told Chinese leadership in 2014 that he was eager to collaborate on the return of fugitives.? In fact, China's ambassador to Canada at the time, Luo Zhaohui, praised the Harper government for this policy. Since Mr. Genuis referred to the word ?extradition?, and has brought it up here several times in the past, I think it's important for our committee and for the record to reflect the entire context. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I will turn to Mr. Balloch first and then to Mr. Saint-Jacques on the same question around first principles. Both of you have said that the relationship between Canada and China is critically important. I want to begin by looking at a very general question. What is it, in both of your minds, that Canada and Canadians do not know about China that they ought to know? It is a very general question, but I think it is, in many ways, ?the? question. We know the United States. They're our lead trade partner. We've had ongoing relations with them for so long. It's true that we have had ongoing relations with China for so long, but I think there are huge misunderstandings between our two countries. What is it we ought to know about China that we don't?, \n\xa0\nMr. Howard Balloch: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mr. Chairman, can I take three and a half days to answer that question, please?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Voices: Oh, oh!\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Howard Balloch: That's a very complicated question. Well, the question is not complicated?the answer is complicated.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0China is a vast place. If you think of it historically, it has been more or less unified for a very long time, unlike Europe, but it is bigger than Europe, and it is culturally more diverse than it appears ethnically, so to understand.... There are a lot of Canadians who understand the China that they see. The China of the south, the China of the northeast and the China of the far west are all very different cultures, in spite of the fact that the Han ethnicity dominates the place so we tend to think of it as unified. It's less unified than we think.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In fact, the history of China has been a history of unification, and then, gradually, dynasties fall apart as regional interests overwhelm the central pull. That's one of the things that Xi Jinping fears. It's that the centre won't hold. It's why he pushed back hard against 30 years of change, which was leading to a weakening of the party's influence around the country. He pushed back to try to reverse that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What is interesting about China is that it is changing. One of the great things that Mao Zedong did?there were many more things he did that were bad?was that he turned a more or less completely illiterate society into a literate society. We see the benefits of that today, when we see Chinese students in all our universities and all over the world. We see the young China becoming more and more worldly.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There's one thing that I would say Canadians should recognize. It's that China is in the midst of a very big transition, and it hasn't reached the end. We don't know what the end is going to be in terms of what happens when a highly literate and increasingly educated society becomes comfortable in their life and looks to expect other things, such as greater respect for the rule of law and seeing that their interests are responded to in some kind of political process. It will take time, but it will keep changing.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We saw the beginnings of that huge change between 1978 and 2014. That was almost continuous?not always at the same pace but almost continuous?and it's only in the last five years that we've seen this kind of counter-reform. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In terms of the changes that we were helping to make in those early days when I was ambassador, which is a long time ago now, at the time of the turn of the century, we helped to establish their National Judges College, where we taught the international principles of the rule of law, the right of legal counsel and all those things. Our Supreme Court justices, members of the Quebec court, which is particularly applicable because of the civil code, and other members of our judicial hierarchy came over to teach the Chinese, who wanted to learn. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0One thing I would say is, don't assume China has stopped changing", " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much for that, Mr. Balloch.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I probably only have about 10 seconds, Mr. Saint-Jacques. Could you at some point in the hearing today expand on the argument you've brought up before? It is, and I'll quote you, ?We also have to cultivate expertise on China in all areas of the public service to ensure a well-informed and more sophisticated China policy.?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If you could tell us how we can do that, it would be helpful. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Bergeron, you have the floor", " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron (Montarville, BQ): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr.\xa0Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, gentlemen, for joining us today. I thank you for your insights that are extremely relevant to the work of this committee, as well as for the work you've done in your respective careers.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You will certainly have an opportunity to follow up on my government colleague's question, but both of you have stressed the need for Canada to, first, not accept arrogant and unjustified, even illegal, behaviour from China, particularly towards Canadian companies or nationals, and then to react.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's the dilemma we face: we feel a bit like the ant next to the elephant. What can we do about it? What suggestions would you have for the members of this committee as to what Canada should do in response to China's unacceptable behaviour towards Canadian citizens or Canadian companies?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Saint-Jacques, more specifically, you mentioned four Australian laws. You didn't have time in 10\xa0minutes to say much more about them, so perhaps you'll have time to do so when you answer this question. Australia being a middle power, like Canada, we're certainly interested in that", " \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for your question, Mr. Bergeron.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First of all, with regard to your first question, I think we need to adopt a much stronger language with China. As soon as we discover a case of interference in Canadian affairs, we have to react. However, there is a difference between influence and interference. The role of an embassy is to try to be as influential as possible. When you send ambassadors abroad, you expect them to become friends with political leaders, economic leaders and academics. So they develop a network, and it is the value of that network that determines their own value.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That said, China expects self-censorship. You see it on Canadian university campuses, where some sinologists are not very critical of China, I think. Maybe it's because they don't want to cut off their access there.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The only language China understands is the language of firmness. For example, when I was ambassador, we negotiated an agreement under which Chinese investigators could come to Canada to meet with fugitive economic criminals. A protocol was established so that there would necessarily be a Mandarin-speaking member of the RCMP at all meetings. At the end of one visit, I was informed by CSIS officials that there had been meetings outside of this framework. I asked them to provide me with the necessary information, and I went to see the Deputy Minister of Public Safety.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I asked him how the visit went. He told me that it went very well and thanked us for our collaboration. I asked him how he would feel if, after receiving guests in his home, he discovered that the silverware had disappeared. He asked me what I meant. I told him that his staff thought they were very smart and I showed him what they had done. I told him that if it happened again, a Chinese investigator would never come back to Canada again. He said that no one was going to violate the memoranda of understanding. So I think that's what needs to be done in all areas.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'd now like to turn to the four laws in Australia. The first is the creation of a register in which all former politicians and senior officials working for a foreign state must be registered. I think that's a good way to ensure more transparency.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The second bill, which was passed, was aimed at preventing interference within the Australian political system, but also within the Chinese-Australian community and on campuses, through rules and punishments.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The third bill created a superministry where intelligence and security matters were consolidated to better address national security issues.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Finally, the last bill was about foreign donations to political organizations. The law now prevents such donations", ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Balloch, would you like to add something?, \n\xa0\nMr. Howard Balloch: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I completely agree with Mr.\xa0Saint-Jacques. I think we need to work with the provinces as well, because they also have important responsibilities to prevent Chinese interference on our campuses and in Chinese-Canadian communities.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I have nothing particular to add on how we do it. I would seek our experts to figure out what we watch for in terms of their interference and how we align proper penalties for breaking those, but I would be very strict. We hear it all the time; people come innocently to Canada, to work in our graduate schools, and then they get a phone call that they are supposed to do something, or not do something, at the request of the Chinese consulate or embassy. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There is a lot we can do. It needs to be looked at. I agree completely with Mr. Saint-Jacques: We need law', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Harris. , \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris (St. John's East, NDP): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you to both of you for your excellent presentations and for your service to Canada in your former roles. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I hear you when you say that there is no such thing as a China policy writ large, but surely this is what you're telling us to do. We need more policy. We need to be firmer with this. We need to have rules about that. We need to take action on this, that and the other thing. Fair enough, because that's what we're here for, I think. It's to try to figure out what those elements are. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Let me just put it to you that the material we received from Global Affairs Canada noted that of Canada's top 10 exports to China in 2018, eight were either natural resources or agricultural products that are ?vulnerable to sudden and arbitrary trade disruptions?, which we've seen, of course, in the past year. Given that, and given your suggestion that we follow the route of Australia, to some extent, in terms of some of the rules?we saw what happened to them in the years following that, as well as to Norway?should we be prepared to accept, in doing this, that with these kinds of disruptions, we can't count on having agricultural trade with China even though it's helpful to our food security, etc.? Would that be what we'd be inviting if we started adopting these rules holus-bolus? I'm not saying that we should or shouldn't; I'm just asking you if that would be the result. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My question is for both of you. , \n\xa0\nMr. Howard Balloch: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We have many interests in China, absolutely. On the export file alone, agricultural and raw materials are very important. We also have a lot of services interests in China. China also has significant interests in our country. If they start taking specific measures against our goods, we should absolutely look at taking specific retaliatory measures. As Mr. Saint-Jacques said, the one thing that China respects is firmness. They don't respect weakness. We should of course try to persuade them that this is the wrong way of trying to resolve disputes, and I think giving in when they are using leverage like that is the wrong response.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, we should have measures. Those don't need, I believe, to be incorporated into law. Those are government policies that can be applied. We've just seen the United States say, in response to the kicking out of some Wall Street journalists, that the Chinese media in the United States has to cut its staff by 40%. That's a good message of reciprocity. Reciprocity is a good principle", " \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I agree with Howard. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would add that in fact that's why we need a strong WTO. The problem with China is that they are expert at using non-tariff barriers, and by this I mean, for instance, phytosanitary reasons. I had to get involved many times to resolve issues related to blackleg in canola exports. That's why we negotiated an agreement back in 2016, which was supposed to be in force until March of last year. It was to ensure a steady flow of Canadian canola exports, but the Chinese, again, are expert at....\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think the message to China should be that we have no problem with them being a superpower and playing a larger role on the international scene, as long as they are a better global citizen and as long as they play by the rules. That's why we need to work with allies to counter those attempts where they are respecting the rules when it suits their purposes?otherwise, they will just penalize you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We should even welcome them to join the CPTPP, but again, as long as they play by the rules. The message should be loud and clear. In that regard, I think our policy should be different from that of the United States", " \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The issue of human rights, of course, has been raised as a big issue in China and elsewhere. I want to raise one issue that has to do with human rights, obviously, because it affects so many Canadians, and that's the issue of fentanyl. It's known to be produced in China and imported widely, and it has caused many thousands of deaths in this country.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As a case study, shall we say, gentlemen, with your experience, what efforts can or should Canada make to do something about that and to stop the importation or the illegal production and obviously infiltration into Canada of this terrible drug that has caused so much damage? Is it a Chinese policy to infiltrate Canada with this drug? Or is this something we need to deal with seriously on a criminal level? Also, why would China not co-operate in such a move?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In 53 seconds, please. , \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In fact, there has been a lot of collaboration on this. It started when I was ambassador. The RCMP liaison officer was very active on this. Every time we had the chance, we impressed on the Chinese that they had to regulate the laboratories and stop the export of fentanyl. In fact, that's why we tried to develop collaboration with them in various fields. It was so they could be more forthcoming on this issue.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think it has started in the right direction. I don't know where it stands now because I don't have the latest knowledge, but we were up to at least being able to sensitize them that this was a huge problem in Canada. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Harris.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Now, for the second round of five minutes, we have Ms. Alleslev. , \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev (Aurora?Oak Ridges?Richmond Hill, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, both of you. This is phenomenal and very important around what Canada needs to do going forward.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Saint-Jacques, you made some very important recommendations in your opening remarks. I wonder if I could clarify or get more information on the one that talked about protocols around reporting. Did I understand you correctly in that you're suggesting we would need protocols for Chinese diplomats for any meetings that they or their proxies have with any level of government officials, Crown corporations or academic institutions? Could you give us some thoughts on that?, \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Well, I didn't go that far. I just said that in every aspect we should base our approach on reciprocity. By reciprocity.... You had Dominic Barton here. He has very limited access, as do the staff of the embassy. Well, then, why should we trot to the Chinese residence to have a good Chinese meal for lunch or dinner? I think we have to be conscious that we are going through the worst crisis in the relationship. We have to be consistent in our signalling.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This being said, of course, you may say that I'm contradicting myself, because we have to find ways to continue. However, speaking with the Chinese takes many forms. I have advocated that in fact we should give a one-pager to Chinese visitors coming into Canada to explain why we are stuck with Mrs. Meng and explain the Canadian position. We should use Chinese media like WeChat and Weibo to explain our policy, because there is a reservoir of goodwill in China on Canada, and many Chinese, in fact, are bit surprised at the harshness of the treatments handed out to Canada", ' \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We should investigate it further in terms of putting some protocols in place', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would say that we have to be clear on where we want to go and base our approach on reciprocity', " \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Perfect.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the second recommendation, you talked about expelling spies. What you didn't mention were perhaps protocols around enhanced review of the processes for Chinese companies doing business in Canada. We know that the Chinese have the national intelligence law, in which articles 7 and 11 demand that ?[a]ny organization or citizen shall support, assist and cooperate with the state intelligence work?, no matter where they are. We also know that 70% of foreign-funded companies have party membership in them.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When we're looking at Chinese companies doing business in Canada, should we be actively enhancing our processes to ensure that we are protecting our intelligence and our free market?, \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Well, on this I would say we are in charge. This is our country. These are our laws, our regulations. We welcome foreign investment, but people have to comply.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On that, this should be consistent for all companies. You are welcome to invest in Canada, but we won't tolerate any attempts to circumvent rules or anything like this.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Howard", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Howard Balloch: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Something I would encourage you to look at is an actual tightening of the Investment Canada Act. We now have rules that insist that takeovers by state-owned companies act like Canadian public corporations in terms of transparency and activity. I think that can be tightened without any damage to the inflow of foreign investment. If they come here, as soon as they are here they should be transparent. They should be absolutely strictly watched to ensure they abide by Canadian law', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If I may add, you were told by a previous witness that the total amount of Chinese investment in Canada is about $16.7 billion. Well, the actual number is $90 billion. The China Institute of the University of Alberta has done a thorough review, which changed the picture: $90 billion is quite different from $16 billion', " \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Absolutely, but wouldn't you say that the national intelligence law of China, as stated here, is in conflict with Canadian law already?, \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Well, there could be extraterritorial applications. That's what we should be concerned about. In fact?and I've listened to some of the comments of Ren Zhengfei, the CEO of Huawei?no Chinese company can refuse a request from the Chinese government to provide information. We know that Alibaba, Tencent and JD.com are providing all the information to the Chinese government to put in place the social credit system. It's a concern. We have to look at ways in which this could have an impact in Canada", " \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Please go ahead?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm sorry, the time is up.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Oliphant", " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you very much, Chair, and thanks to both of you for being here today.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As recently as yesterday, I was asked what keeps me awake at night in my job as parliamentary secretary, and it is, without a doubt, consular issues. It is, without a doubt, Canadians around the world in various states of turmoil or detention, etc. The issues that keep me probably the most awake are the issues of arbitrary detentions like those of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, as well as the arbitrary resentencing of Mr. Schellenberg.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Maybe I'll start with you, Mr. Saint-Jacques, because I know that you have a personal interest in this and a care that you've expressed. You're both saying in various ways that engagement needs to be realistic, and not romantic, but that it is necessary. We cannot not engage with China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I've been working on this for many months now, and I have not found a silver bullet in terms of how to engage, at what level to engage, how to demand and how to express how Canada should be operating in this world right now, given our extradition agreement with the United States, given our court proceedings that are continuing and given our absolute concern for the well-being of Canadians arbitrarily held in detention. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to push a bit on that for your advice with respect to what in the diplomatic tool kit we may not have been doing and what we can do more of. We have unprecedented numbers of allies we are working with, and other countries haven't done this, but it's not working yet. I've been told by some ambassadors from other countries that we have to settle in and recognize that it will be a while, but I'm anxious and I'm impatient.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm wondering if you could help us with that", " \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would say that consular issues kept me up at night as well. When I was the ambassador, we had two Canadians who were executed on drug charges despite all the pleas that Prime Minister Harper wrote to Xi Jinping the day before one was going to be executed, to no avail, and Governor General Johnston had raised this. Of course, having worked with Michael Kovrig and having recruited him to come to Beijing, I think about him every day.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Again, I would base all of this on our values and, again, we should not compromise. We need to explain and we should explain why those values are important to Canadians, and we need to be consistent in the way we address this. This means that, assuming that we will have a more official contact with the Chinese and at some point relations will resume, we have to explain why we won't tolerate behaviour that we see as bullying or as that of a spoiled child, because in many ways I believe China is now acting like a spoiled child.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Again, we need to explain that, look, Canada has been very helpful to China. As Howard said, we have helped to modernize their legal structure. When I arrived in China for the first time, in Beijing in 1984, they had about 200 lawyers that we helped to train, and the level of justice has been moving in the right direction", " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could I ask what it looks like to not tolerate? I'm trying to push you on that. What does that look like?, \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There are ways.... I would distinguish what you can do here, because we now see more and more instances of interference where we need to push back. I don't think we have been very good at reminding the Chinese of everything that Canada has done, especially through the $1-billion aid program that was terminated in 2013, which helped to create the dairy industry and improve the pork industry. We helped to create the ministry of environmental protection and so on. Everywhere I travelled in China, people would come to me and thank Canada for what we had done. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Again, Canada is well perceived. That's why there are children of leaders who have studied in Canada. Proportionate to our population, we have a much larger number of Chinese students than the U.S. does. Canada is very well perceived for all kinds of reasons.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In terms of pushing back, this has to be done in a respectful way. That's why I would argue that in some cases we have to go in jointly with partners, not with a megaphone, but just to say, ?Here are our views.?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Oliphant.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Albas, you have five minutes", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas (Central Okanagan?Similkameen?Nicola, CPC): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'd like to thank all of our witnesses for their service to this country. Their ongoing expertise here today is most welcome.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'll start with Mr. Saint-Jacques. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You had an editorial in December 2019 in the Vancouver Sun. You argued that Canada ?should react quickly and firmly when we find instances of interference in Canadian affairs, including among Canadians of Chinese origin, espionage activities or attempts to limit debate on Canadian campuses.? It seems your testimony today reaffirms that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This weekend I happened to see, on social media, that a school district?No. 43 Coquitlam?superintendent was being interviewed and admitted, through that interaction, that her school district actually felt it was completely appropriate to be taking funds for different activities from the Chinese government. Now, I've never heard of a foreign state actually funding these things. I don't know all the details. I'd like to see those details come out.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Sam Cooper this morning wrote in his Twitter feed that since the early 2000s, a former PLA officer and developer Li Zhe started making rounds with Vancouver area mayors, obviously taking them to China on different junkets. This became quite an issue in 2007. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I've never heard of this happening at the local government level. Have you heard of these things? What should we be looking to do in this matter? In your estimation, how far up the political scale does this go?, \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Well, I'm not aware of cases where a local school would have received money from a Chinese entity.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This being said, I think that many schools and universities are struggling with, for instance, the Confucius Institute, because they don't have the resources to offer Mandarin training. Just to come back to what Mr. Fragiskatos was asking earlier, we need to develop our expertise on China, and that means learning Mandarin and getting more young people to visit China to learn the language. Universities are struggling. They don't have resources to create their own courses. Here comes the Confucius centre, which says, ?We'll take care of this?, and of course, their curriculum is biased.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would say also that a number of members of Parliament have been to China on trips paid for by the Chinese government, but in fact, I think we have done some of that ourselves in the past. Probably it would be necessary to clarify the rules that apply. On the one hand, again, I think we need to develop?and I would encourage you to develop?links with the Chinese Communist Party, because we need to understand them if we want to try to influence them, but at the same time, probably this should be done using our own money", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, and that was going to be my question. Who is paying for it, and what is, as Mr. Genuis remarked earlier, the quid pro quo attached to it?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Are there any other issues? I know that Waterloo had publicly issued its desire to know, from our security establishment, what parameters they should have when they're doing contracts with certain companies. At the time I asked, they said they had not heard anything back.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Should there be a public display of these things, in terms of what the policies should be? Should the government be developing those policies and giving that insight? Where appropriate, should the government be funding those kinds of cases when these contracts are having to be cut?, \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Well, in fact there are more efforts being made now to sensitize, especially academics, regarding some aspects of collaborating with China. When I was ambassador, I recall discussing with some academics. They were working on projects that were getting close to the commercial phase. I said, ?Who owns the intellectual property on this?? They said, ?Well, I'm a researcher. I don't...?, etc. I said, ?No, no, you have to be concerned about this, because this could have high value.?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Also, we have to be concerned about technology that could have dual uses. Therefore, on this, I think the government has in place good controls to prevent this. That's why I was saying earlier that on artificial intelligence we need to have another look, because with things like facial recognition there are some dangers", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Monsieur Dubourg. , \n\xa0\nMr. Emmanuel Dubourg (Bourassa, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr.\xa0Chairman.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for your testimony this morning.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'd like to talk to you about Huawei. It is well known that this is one of the elements in our current relationship with China. I saw recently in the media that Canadian companies, such as Telus, are asking the government to allow Huawei to install its 5G network.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Saint-Jacques, you've talked a lot about Australia banning 5G, unlike the UK, which wants to move forward.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Although companies like Huawei claim to be independent, former ambassador David Mulroney advises the government to keep in mind that there is no truly independent Chinese company.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In this context, what can you tell us about the decision we need to make on Huawei?, \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You'll understand that there's a great diversity of views on this issue.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think we need to pay special attention to security issues, because these are fundamental issues for our future prosperity.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I know there are many Canadian companies that have unfortunately had their technology stolen. Maybe they weren't careful enough. That's why I was saying earlier that we have to react and lay charges every time something like this is discovered.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As far as Huawei is concerned, I think the memorandum of understanding that was put in place to allow it to work in Canada has worked well. All its equipment is tested before it is used in Canada. The Communications Security Establishment is doing an excellent job of that. It's important.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As I said in my remarks, perhaps the solution would be to say that all listed companies are invited. This would force Huawei to make a strategic decision: should it create a company listed in Canada, which would be listed on the TSX Venture Exchange in Toronto? This could bring more transparency to its operations, especially if there are Canadians on its board of directors.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Of course, we must continue to monitor it very closely to ensure that there are no problems. The 5G is much more complex than 3G or 4G, but Canada will have to make a Canadian decision on this, taking into account all points of view", " \n\xa0\nMr. Emmanuel Dubourg: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I thank you for suggesting these potential solutions.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Very quickly, like my colleague Mr.\xa0Oliphant, I would like to return to the cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 You have both been ambassadors to China, and Mr.\xa0Saint-Jacques explained how long this process could take. If you were currently ambassador to China, what other action would you take to ensure that these two gentlemen are released more quickly?, \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This is an extremely difficult situation. The previous government faced the same difficulty in the cases of Kevin and Julia Garratt and Huseyin Celil, who is still being held in Urumqi, Xinjiang. These issues are very difficult and require a consistent and coherent approach and repeating the same messages.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In this case, as soon as China began to apply punitive measures against Canadian trade, there should have been an immediate response. In the case of canola, we should have gone to the World Trade Organization, WTO, right away to protest. China is a member of the WTO, so you have to use that kind of forum.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I think we need to show China everything we won't do to help it. There is a lot of collaboration between our countries, especially in the area of health care?China envies the Canadian system?and in the area of stock market and financial controls. We can help in a number of areas. So we have to tell them that until things improve, we will not help them", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Emmanuel Dubourg: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Fine. Thank you', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Bergeron, you have two and a half minutes', " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Would you have gone as far as retaliatory measures in addition to an appeal to the World Trade Organization?, \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I think we need to react. We now have a $51-billion trade deficit with China. That worries me.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Why don't we do more extensive inspections, for example, to make sure that children's toys coming into Canada do not contain lead paint?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In addition, 70% of the apple juice and 60% of the frozen fish in Canada comes from China. Are we sure it's safe to eat? We might have some surprises on that side", ' \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It is therefore a matter of using the same strategy as the Chinese and applying phytosanitary measures to ensure the safety of the products', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If we adopt a laissez-faire attitude and let ourselves be stepped on,[English] you end up as roadkill', " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This is very interesting.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'd like to address the issue of university funding, among others. This opens up a broad issue, the underfunding of our universities. This obviously involves not only the provincial and Quebec governments, but also the federal government, through its transfers to the provinces.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Beyond that, Mr.\xa0Balloch referred, as did another witness earlier, to the need for closer collaboration with the provinces on health and education issues.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What would you recommend we do in that connection?, \n\xa0\nMr. Howard Balloch: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We must be very strict that any financing that comes into the country comes into it in ways that are transparent, and also that it is used for the purposes for which it is intended. I am sure you will talk to university presidents. I have met with university presidents to talk about this, to make sure there are no strings attached about what the financing does.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Of course, our provinces are entirely in charge of education, and at the secondary school level I agree with Mr. Saint-Jacques that it is not a bad thing to have some funding for Mandarin training and so on.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0By the way, Canada?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm sorry to interrupt, but we have to go on to Mr. Harris. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Harris, you have two and a half minutes. , \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'd like to let you continue, but perhaps you'll have another chance afterwards. I have only two and a half minutes, but I'm interested in the question raised by one of your other colleagues, Joseph Caron, who was ambassador from 2001 to 2005.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 He was talking about human rights and suggested that our dialogue with China should be at both levels: with the government and with the people as well. I think some reference has been made to the people of China being a different category. He said, ?Tangible programs, not just statements, must be put in place for long-term impacts and results.?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Do both of you or either of you have any ideas about what that might look like in terms of tangible, specific programs, not just protests or bringing it up every time you meet with leaders and things like that?, \n\xa0\nMr. Howard Balloch: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'll go quickly because I'll follow up from what I was saying.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the past, we have funded Canadian studies in Chinese universities. Our embassy has engaged in social media in reaching out to the people. Our network of diplomatic posts in China is large. Having our diplomats go out to universities and go out to the centres that are the most open towards change in China is something that we should be doing all the time. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There are a lot of people in China who welcome change and who look to countries like Canada for inspiration about how their country will change. We should encourage that all the time, and there are a lot of programs that we can do to do that. , \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On that point, it was noted by Ambassador Barton when he was with us and talked about the numbers of Canadian staff serving in China, but also, it was critiqued by another former diplomat, who said that we have a lot of trade commissioners but we don't have sufficient capacity concerning political and advocacy work. Is that true?, \n\xa0\nMr. Howard Balloch: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I'm going to answer that right away, because that particular former diplomat has been spouting that for a long time. , \n\xa0\nMr. Jack Harris: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is he right?, \n\xa0\nMr. Howard Balloch: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0He wasn't actually a career diplomat, and he is wrong.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When I was ambassador, Guy Saint-Jacques was my number two, and he ran a political-economic section of maybe 10 people. There wasn't a single person there who didn't speak Chinese and who didn't have his own networks and didn't reach out into the community.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We can do more, but we should not be criticized for what we've done in the past. We've had a very professional service in China and we have done lots of advocacy. We can do more, but the government has to make some choices about how much it does in any single country", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Harris, I'm sorry. You're a bit over time, so congratulations on that.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We're going next to Mr. Williamson for five minutes", " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To our two witnesses today, thank you very much for appearing. It's been very interesting.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Balloch, you had an interesting observation, or perhaps conclusion, which caught my attention: ?Engagement has always been principally aimed at serving Canadian interests, and only indirectly at encouraging systemic internal change in China.? Could you elaborate on this a little more? \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Are you summarizing the Government of Canada's policy? Was this the policy within the Department of Foreign Affairs or was it the policy from the ambassador's desk in Beijing?, \n\xa0\nMr. Howard Balloch: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It was the policy of every government that I served. I started looking at China intensely in the 1980s, when Mr. Mulroney was prime minister. That got upset for a little while because of the Tiananmen crisis, but he started to re-engage before the end of his time, and then Mr. Chr?tien's and so on. It has been very much a multi-party consensus about the importance of China. Whether we've done it as well as we could have, that's another issue, but it's been throughout the government.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I remember governments of both governing parties saying to their ministers that it wasn't just Foreign Affairs. It was Foreign Affairs and all of the rest of them, the whole cabinet. Every department of government had to start taking China more seriously, for our interests. It was not because we were trying to change China, but because our interests counted", " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Am I wrong in thinking that underlying that, whether it was the debate around granting?this is going back 30 years or at least 25 years?most favoured nation status, the WTO...? There was, at least as it was sold to the public, always an underlying emphasis that trade is good but trade will also result in a gradual change in China's outlook when it comes to being rules-based and when it comes to respect for human rights. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Internally, regarding trade, I can see how that would benefit Canada, but externally to the public there was always an underlying emphasis on rights", " \n\xa0\nMr. Howard Balloch: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, and I think that, except for the last few years, personal freedoms in China grew substantially between 1978 and 2014. The legal system evolved in positive ways. It hasn't gotten to where we would have liked it to get. These were indirect changes brought about, in part, by their entering the WTO.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I can remember, when I was ambassador, Zhu Rongji saying to our Prime Minister, ?Thank goodness we're there because now I can make the changes in China that we need to make, to make it a modern society.? They were intermingled, but our purpose, primarily, was to serve our interests", " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In light of where we are today, should this trade focus continue, or is it time, perhaps, to put a greater emphasis on?and I think you've both been speaking to this today?where the relationship has not worked as well as we'd hoped, whether it's minorities being detained in the western part of the country or the two Canadians, and there are more actually, being detained as well?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We had someone here speaking from the department, saying that the focus is trade and engagement, and that is going to continue. Might we not want to reset that dial now and perhaps warn businesses in Canada that if they trade in China there are obvious risks, and for the Government of Canada to put a greater accent on the relationship on rights, internally, in China?, \n\xa0\nMr. Howard Balloch: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I wouldn't change our general balance of focus. Always we should be arguing for both and we should be trying to encourage positive change in China, which does serve our interest, which is to have China become a greater and more law-abiding part of the global community. We can't be unidimensional in this. We shouldn't be unidimensional only on the economic side", " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 However, your earlier comments suggested very much that we were unidimensional, that it was economics-based?, \n\xa0\nMr. Howard Balloch: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It was interests-based. It is in our interests to have our universities working together with China on finding scientific solutions to agricultural problems. It's in our interests to have our security agencies working with their Chinese counterparts on international crime and the flow of fentanyl and other drugs. Our interests are not based solely on trade or economics", ' \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Sure', ' \n\xa0\nMr. Howard Balloch: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0They are very widespread', " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I agree with that, and that is also a function of China's becoming a much bigger player as well. , \n\xa0\nMr. Howard Balloch: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Of course", " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thirty years ago, I don't think they were in a position to play the influential role they do today.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think Mr. Saint-Jacques referenced free trade. Would you embark on a free trade agreement with China today, or do you think that should be put into the deep freeze?, \n\xa0\nMr. Howard Balloch: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would embark?not today, because we have problems in our relationship?on encouraging China to enter into the comprehensive partnership we have in Asia with other countries, probably as a first step?, \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is that the TPP you're talking about?, \n\xa0\nMr. Howard Balloch: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm sorry to interrupt, but we're out of time.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I'm going now to Mr. Fragiskatos, for five minutes. , \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I apologize, because I'm not sure if it was Mr. Balloch or Mr. Saint-Jacques who made the point earlier about some within China thinking that Canada has been treated unfairly in recent months, in fact since December 2018. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It may have been Mr. Saint-Jacques.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Can you expand on that? Is this something you are hearing through your network of contacts, Mr. Saint-Jacques? Elaborate, perhaps, on what exactly you've been told", " \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It is linked to how Canada is perceived in China. In this case, it's clear that the issue of Mrs. Meng is coordinated in the office of President Xi Jinping. Therefore, now that he has absolute power and absolute authority, it's difficult for anyone to criticize him, but I've heard from various sources that some people who like Canada and appreciate what we have done in the past and know the potential for future collaboration are a bit dismayed at the status.... I know that Ambassador Barton is working to try to contact people, but, again, we should not expect any progress until Mrs. Meng is released. , \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You also made a point in your opening, Mr. Saint-Jacques, about expanding our ties when it comes to artificial intelligence as a way of building a bridge. You offered a number of different ideas in that regard. Could you expand on that point?, \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I was expressing a concern because Canada is at the forefront with regard to artificial intelligence, and when you look at what's happening in China, you will see that facial recognition is now used in a very comprehensive way and a social credit system has been put in place whereby each citizen is given a number of points such that if you express criticism of the Chinese government you will lose points. After losing enough points, you can no longer take the high-speed train or travel by air. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would like to avoid knowing in the future that Canadian technology was in fact used to help put that system in place. That's why we should review and explain to universities and various groups exactly what kind of collaboration is going on right now", " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for that clarification.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You also made the point in your opening remarks that we ?should also look at ways to better support democracy in Hong Kong and Taiwan.? Are there any specifics on that? How exactly could Canada do that?, \n\xa0\nMr. Guy Saint-Jacques: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think it was Phil Calvert, a former colleague of mine, who said in his testimony that in the case of Taiwan we should try to further develop our relationship. I agree with that. In fact, there is the rule of law in Taiwan, and we should look at ways to support the very clear result that came out of the elections in January and say that we support democracy and that no pressure should be put on Taiwan.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the case of Hong Kong, it's a very messy situation. China needs Hong Kong, because 70% of foreign investment going to China goes through Hong Kong. There is no Chinese city that can play the role of Hong Kong, because in Hong Kong there is the rule of law, but not in China. We should express support.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the best of all worlds, we are at a stage where a mediator should come in to try to suggest ways to appease the sides, but, of course, the Chinese government will never suggest that, and that's why we have to make representations in Beijing with our allies to try to convince China to put some water in its wine", " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I've left you only 30 seconds, Mr. Balloch, but on the point about promoting democracy as best we can in Taiwan and Hong Kong, do you have any thoughts?, \n\xa0\nMr. Howard Balloch: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I agree with Guy on the Taiwan question. It's got a lot to say for it.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On Hong Kong, I would say that we also need to be more robust in our discussion with the Hong Kong government. I live there, and the Hong Kong government has often not stood up in the way it should stand up to protect the rights of Hong Kong citizens, including 300,000 Canadians", ' \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would like to thank the former ambassadors for their service to Canada and for their statements today. They have been very helpful.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Colleagues, we will now suspend for five minutes as we get ready for the next panel. We'll see you in a few minutes. \xa0\xa0(1120)\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\xa0(1130)\xa0\xa0\n\n, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Colleagues, this meeting is called back to order.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We have, by teleconference, three witnesses. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First of all, we have Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia and director of the China power project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. She's joining us from Washington. With her is Mr. David Shambaugh, professor and director of the China policy program at George Washington University. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We also have someone who's normally based in Washington but today is in Oslo, Norway?Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much for joining us today. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We'll ask each of you to speak for up to 10 minutes, starting with Ms. Glaser. , \n\xa0\nMs. Bonnie Glaser (Senior Adviser for Asia and Director, China Power Project, Center for Strategic and International Studies, As an Individual): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you for inviting me to appear as a witness at this hearing on Canada-China relations. As an observer of Chinese foreign and security policy for more than 40 years, I'm pleased to provide my assessment of China's evolving global role.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0China's involvement in the world is a very complicated picture. Several of your prior witnesses have related examples of China's positive impact, including the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and its contributions to UN peacekeeping operations. However, it is also important to examine examples of its negative impact and fully appreciate China's intentions to modify the international system in ways that are detrimental to democracies.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When Chinese officials claim they seek to uphold the international system, it's important to understand that they have a different definition of the international system from western liberal democracies. Beijing supports global institutions but rejects liberal norms and values. It opposes the network of U.S. alliances established after World War II that underpins the international system.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Xi Jinping has called for China not only to participate in but also to lead global governance reform. In various forums, including key UN agencies, China is seeking to reframe prevailing norms and to introduce its own concepts. Beijing has long expressed dissatisfaction with the democratic governance system, but it has only been in recent years that it has begun to push for its own alternative vision. China's more assertive stance is a result of both its assessment that the international balance of power is shifting in China's favour, with the onset of the 2008 global financial crisis, and also the opportunities, frankly, presented by the Trump administration's withdrawal from several key multilateral organizations.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the UN, China is introducing its own rules and norms. In the Human Rights Council, Beijing is promoting orthodox interpretations of national sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs that weaken widely accepted international norms of human rights, transparency and accountability. In areas where international law is still evolving, China has been especially active. Alongside Russia, China has pushed its version of Internet governance that emphasizes state sovereignty and territoriality in the digital space. Other examples include outer space, the deep sea and the polar regions. In the Arctic, China has labelled itself a near-Arctic state, with the goal of inserting itself into international debates over Arctic governance.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Xi Jinping has taken measures to operationalize China's long-standing positions that U.S. alliances are Cold War relics that should be eliminated. In 2014, Xi put forward his vision for an Asia free of alliances and the military presence of the United States. In the South China Sea, through which an estimated $3.4 trillion in trade passes annually, China is aggressively pushing to oust foreign players. In its negotiations with the members of ASEAN on a code of conduct, Beijing proposed that the parties prohibit holding military exercises with countries outside Southeast Asia and bar co-operation with energy companies from outside the region.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Abroad, China is actively promoting its development model. At the 19th party congress in October 2017, Xi Jinping explicitly touted China's experience, stating that China's miracle of rapid economic growth and long-term social stability ?offers a new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence?. This unprecedented push is in part to secure the position of the Chinese Communist Party at home, but it's also intended to bolster the legitimacy of authoritarian political systems worldwide and weaken the appeal of democracy. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When it comes to international rules, China's compliance is selective, and its observance of law is weakest in the maritime realm, in China's near seas, where it prioritizes safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests. Beijing rejected the July 2016 findings of an UNCLOS arbitral tribunal, which ruled that China's nine-dash line is invalid as a claim to resource rights.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0China's intimidation of Taiwan, a democracy where over 23 million people reside, has reached new heights in recent years. China's military exercises have become increasingly provocative and dangerous, with large numbers of fighters, bombers and reconnaissance aircraft crossing the centre line of the Taiwan Strait. Beijing has poached seven of Taipei's diplomatic partners since 2016, leaving the island with only 15 countries that recognize it. Countries as well as companies that are seen as challenging Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan are issued stern warnings and threatened with punishment.\xa0\xa0(1135)\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Canada is among the countries, of course, that have been targeted for harming Chinese interests and offending Chinese sensibilities. The arrest of Canadian citizens and the ban on imports of Canadian canola oil and other agricultural products are just the latest examples of Chinese economic coercion aimed at punishing countries that harm Chinese interests.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The list of target countries is long: Norway, for granting the Nobel Peace Prize to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo; Japan, for arresting a Chinese ship captain after he rammed a Japanese Coast Guard vessel in disputed waters; the Philippines, for confronting Chinese fishermen operating in Scarborough Shoal; and on and on, as well as South Korea for THAAD, etc.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0China does not respect rule of law. lt does not share liberal democratic values, and it does not protect human rights. It is seeking to alter the international system in ways that would be favourable to China and detrimental to western interests. China's tool of domestic governance, its detention of over one million Uighurs, its censorship of expression, and its social credit system should not be a model for the rest of the world.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Although l'm not a Canadian citizen, l'd like to offer a few suggestions for Canada to consider in its policy going forward. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 First, establish priorities in your relations with China. Identify what Canada must insist on and what it will not tolerate. Be firm and consistent. A precondition for the resumption of normal bilateral ties should be the release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. Beijing ultimately respects countries that stand up for their interests. Canada's priorities and principles in its relations with China could be set out in a strategy paper similar to that issued by Sweden or embedded in a broader foreign policy white paper as Australia has done.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Second, where possible, pursue a collective response. Seek to work with like-minded countries to protect shared interests. Japan, along with the U.S. and the European Union, filed a WTO case against Chinese actions to drastically reduce rare earth exports in 2010, and the challengers won in 2014. I think Canada, the U.S. and other like-minded countries should establish a multilateral reserve fund to compensate any of the fund's members for costs imposed by Chinese economic coercion. The fund should be capitalized by its members as well as by private sector firms that might be affected by coercion. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Third and finally, identify sources of leverage and use them. Although Canada is a middle power, not a superpower, it still has ways in which it can get China's attention. Pulling out of China's AIIB, which I know some politicians have advocated for, would not significantly affect the bank's lending capacity, of course, but it would deal a blow to China's reputation. Canada should also consider invoking the Magnitsky Law against China, which allows the government to block visas for officials and freeze or seize their assets in Canada. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Calling out China for its human rights abuses in Xinjiang would be consistent with Canada's long-standing support for human rights and freedom, and doing so might encourage countries to take similar measures. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you again for inviting me to testify before the special committee", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Shambaugh', " \n\xa0\nMr. David Shambaugh (Professor and Director, China Policy Program, The George Washington University, As an Individual): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you, sir. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It is indeed a distinct honour and privilege for me to be invited to appear before this distinguished parliamentary special committee.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I apologize for not having submitted this opening statement in time for it to be translated into French, but I only received the invitation to testify a few days ago. I was able to prepare the statement only over the weekend, but I have submitted it and hopefully your interpreters have it in front of them and it will help them.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have been a student and scholar of China for 45 years. I read and speak Chinese fairly fluently. I've visited China, Hong Kong and Taiwan hundreds of times over 41 consecutive years, and I have lived in China for a total of five years. Until five years ago, I had extremely good access to institutions and individuals throughout the party, government, military, academia and society in China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0While a continually fascinating and complex land, the country's current trajectory is quite troubling to me in many dimensions. I commend this special committee on your inquiry, as it's a critical element in Canada's re-evaluation of its relations with the People's Republic of China, particularly in the wake of, but not exclusively related to, the deterioration of bilateral relations in the wake of the cases of Meng Wanzhou, Michael Kovrig, Michael Spavor and Robert Schellenberg.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The reason I say ?not exclusively related to? is that it seems apparent?to me, at least, south of our common border?that over the last two to three years the Canadian government and civil society have been engaged in a collective national gestalt over your relations with China. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The aforementioned cases may have crystallized and brought to the surface a simmering subterranean debate, but there are other unsettling dimensions of relations with China that you have encountered in recent years related to espionage, Chinese investment into key sectors of the Canadian economy, technology theft, intellectual property rights theft?things that other countries are also experiencing?Chinese United Front activities among the Chinese-Canadian diaspora, influence operations towards Chinese elites, the human rights situation in China and other difficulties. I would submit that these issues collectively have led to your national discussion and this special committee's inquiry.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This is, I would submit, a very healthy and very normal gestalt, if you will, for any democracy. From what I have been able to observe from south of our border, this national discussion has proceeded in a very rational, responsible yet probing manner. It's not over yet, and this committee's inquiry will play an important role in its outcome. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Over the past few days, I have read the transcripts of all the previous testimony before the committee, and this morning I was able to see some but not all of the ambassadors' testimony on my way here. Let me particularly associate myself with the opening statements of Phil Calvert, Paul Evans and Charles Burton. Although I do not agree with all their responses in the Q and A period, I did find their opening statements to be very much in line with what I believe. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I also periodically follow the Canadian press and have had recent discussions over the last year with Canadian academic colleagues, as well as diplomats and officials in other departments in Ottawa.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0From all of this, I discern that there is a fairly fundamental rethink going on in Canada concerning the fundamental assumptions and principles of its relationship with China. Again, this is all very normal, very therapeutic and probably overdue, and it will produce hopefully a recalibrated approach towards China that best serves Canadian national interests. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Canada is hardly alone in having such a national rethink about China. South of the border, we Americans have been experiencing a very similar national debate concerning our relations with China in recent years. My colleagues and I would be happy to discuss this with you today if you're interested, but I would just say a couple of things about it. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First, it's been brewing for a number of years. It predated but has coalesced under the Trump administration. It has resulted in a substantial critique and re-evaluation of the so-called engagement paradigm that has undergirded U.S. relations with China for four decades. It has resulted in a very bipartisan, fundamental hardening and toughening of U.S. policies towards China across the board. While there is no total agreement on this in the United States, I would say that there is a substantial majority agreement about it. Again, we would be happy to elaborate on that if you're interested. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Moreover, the U.S. and Canada are not alone in undertaking such a fundamental re-evaluation of relations with China. So is the European Union. Europe-China relations are something I've followed for decades rather closely, and I have just returned from Berlin, where we convened a transatlantic symposium on U.S. and European relations with China. My colleague Bonnie Glaser here also recently co-organized a similar German-American dialogue on China, so we're familiar with the European situation. Yun Sun is, of course, today in Norway.\xa0\xa0(1145)\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 In Europe, there has also been a continent-wide rethinking about and hardening of policies towards China. While continuing to call for collaboration and co-operation in several fields, for the first time in any official statements of the European Commission, its most recent so-called communication, which is like a white paper, described China as a ?strategic competitor? and a ?systemic rival?. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0A similar rethinking is also ongoing in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea and in several Southeast Asian countries. Other witnesses, including those this morning, have raised the Australian legislation that came out of its national debate. I would agree with them that this is a good model for Canada and other democracies to follow.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Canada is hardly alone in rethinking its relations with China, and there are good empirical reasons why these countries are all re-evaluating their relations with China, namely that the entire world is facing a much more domestically repressive and much more externally confrontational Chinese regime under Xi Jinping.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0China has changed; thus the previous premises of our engagement policies need to be rethought and replaced with much more hard-headed responses to China's more offensive behaviour. We cannot cling to outdated Kantian liberal preferences and policies of co-operation with a regime that is among the world's most repressive on earth; is largely mercantilist in its trade and investment policies; is building a world-class offensive military; is increasingly expansionist in its foreign policies, including its belt and road; and increasingly bullies other countries.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Just very briefly, related to this, I was quite interested in this morning's testimony. One of your committee members raised a really interesting question. What do Canadians need to know about China that they don't? We can talk about that today, but I would submit that Canadian academics, at least, need to stop focusing on China as a cultural and civilizational entity and start studying it in depth as a Chinese communist Leninist state, an essentially mixed economy but with Soviet characteristics.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Academics need to start thinking more like intelligence analysts, in my view. The U.K. experience is helpful here. I used to live and teach in the United Kingdom. They had a very similar situation about 20 years ago. They undertook a parliamentary inquiry into the state of Chinese studies in the U.K", " which produced a series of government-funded posts going to certain priority areas. We can pursue that, and I would just recommend that for consideration in Canada as well.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Let me just conclude my brief time with this last point. Again, Canada is not alone in being on the receiving end of Chinese punitive actions for behaviour that Beijing considers unfriendly or that violates its so-called core interests. By my count, including Canada, there are 17 countries that have been punished with punitive retaliatory actions by China. Bonnie has just named several of those, so I will leave it at that. We can go into the 17 cases if you're interested, but you're not alone. There is a pattern here. It doesn't take a social scientist to see the pattern.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The precipitating events vary by country, but China's behaviour and China's retaliatory actions also vary by case. I'd note, simply to make you aware, that Canada is hardly in a unique position at present, however regrettable. We Americans stand 100% with Canada under these trying circumstances.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Sweden is also currently experiencing similar circumstances over the Gui Minhai case and other bilateral difficulties, but what Canada and Sweden are experiencing now has become a demonstrable international pattern in Beijing's punitive and aggressive actions towards others.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The entire world is now dealing with a Chinese Communist Party and state that feels emboldened, entitled and empowered. The consequent questions for all of us?certainly for democracies but I would submit for all countries in the world?are the following: What type of push-back is warranted? Second, can we live with a friction-ridden relationship with China? Third, can we escape the trap of the engagement paradigm that leaves us to seek or return to a so-called normal relationship of co-operation with China? Fourth, will the world bend to China's pressure tactics and extraordinary commercial leverage? Lastly, if the world does bend to such tactics, what does it mean for international order?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Canada and Sweden are currently on the front lines of these questions, but the entire world, regardless of political systems, has a major interest in developing convincing answers and effective responses to these difficult questions. I think Bonnie just gave you a series of good recommendations that I would share as well.\xa0\xa0(1150)\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you very much for your attention. I look forward to your questions", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Shambaugh.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Now we will go to Oslo. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Sun, you are spending your evening with us, so thank you very much for that. , \n\xa0\nMs. Yun Sun (Director, China Program, The Stimson Center, As an Individual): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you, Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Good morning. It is a great honour for me to be invited to provide perspectives and analysis to the Special Committee on Canada-China Relations. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I was asked to provide views on China's global role and approach to the international system, as well as to make recommendations on Canada-China relations.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Historically and traditionally, the international system that China has known and been accustomed to is one of hegemonic stability, centred on and dominated by the Middle Kingdom, a superior and self-perceived benevolent country or civilization. The hegemon-China's superiority in military and economic power formed the foundation for peace and stability through deterrence, coercion and war, and the benevolence, as demonstrated by the hegemon's provision of public goods to help advance the culture through infrastructure, in China's view, anchored the desirability of such a system to other states.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In China's view, Chinese superiority is the foundation for the stability and harmony of the system. In the Chinese conception of the world order, harmony does not [Technical difficulty?Editor] from equality among all countries. Instead, harmony originates from a well-defined and well-enforced hierarchy, in which roles and responsibilities were assigned according to each country's [Technical difficulty?Editor] power. The vision stipulates that states recognize and pledge their deference to the strong and benevolent hegemon, and that's when peace and stability will ensue. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This system existed for 2,000 years in China, until it encountered its most critical existential threat, when the western system of nation states?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm sorry to interrupt, Ms. Sun. We're having a little problem with the sound. Could I ask you to hold on for one moment while we see if we can fix that? \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We're going to suspend for a couple of moments.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0(1150)\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\xa0(1155)\xa0\xa0\n\n, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Sun, would you please proceed?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you", ' \n\xa0\nMs. Yun Sun: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 This system encountered its most critical existential threat when the western system of nation states prevailed in Asia. While the China-centric system preached the homogeneity of the Chinese civilization among all states on its periphery, the western notion of nation states emphasizes their heterogeneity, and hence, differing and competitive national interests. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What we have witnessed with China?s foreign policy in recent years is an assiduous attempt to break away from western discourse and re-establish the traditional Chinese model of hegemonic stability. In China?s view, China?s primacy in the region stands a reasonable chance to prevail. China, through its power, will create an alternative order based on a different set of values.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This is essentially the goal that the current Chinese leaders are pursuing. China?s rising vitality and intensification of its foreign policy behaviours is the manifestation of its bid for regional hegemony and global power. That regional hegemony may not deny U.S. access to the East Asian and West Pacific regions, but it does dictate that the U.S. must follow the rules developed and enforced by the regional power. This is the fundamental cause of the escalating strategic rivalry and great power competition we are witnessing between the U.S. and China. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The U.S. has traditionally played the role of an offshore balancer to ensure the plurality of the region by channelling power into the region. However, as China strategically applies its ?carrot and stick? foreign policy to displace the United States, first in the Asian region and then more broadly across the globe, this great power competition most likely will continue to intensify. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Here I wish to say a few words in particular about China?s mentality about the west, which is highly relevant for the discussion we are having here today. When China?s regional superiority crumbled in the 19th century, what ensued was a sense of pathos, of self-pity and a sense of victimhood targeted toward the west. With China?s rise and resumption of great power status, it rapidly evolved into China?s own destiny manifesto, a firm belief in China?s preordained and predestined superiority to lead the world and a mentality as well as an urge for revenge when the west seems to reject or disrespect China?s rightful status. In other words, China today still maintains a high level of victim mentality abnormal for a great power, which translates into a heightened sense of vulnerability, hostility and retaliatory actions when it is triggered. Due to this mentality and China?s newly acquired capacity and instruments to inflict damage on other countries, the policy toward China by any country has become increasingly challenging.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As shown by the recent Meng Wanzhou case and China?s retaliation, Canada is caught between two great powers in their tug of war. In China, there is no doubt that the reparation of the ties or the so-called renormalization of bilateral relations will have to be predicated upon Meng?s release, or at the minimum, upon her not being extradited to the United States, combined with significant policy moves from the Canadian government to show goodwill toward China. Anything less than significant will be appreciated by China but unlikely to generate the policy change people would like to see. The recent Chinese reaction to Canada?s position on the coronavirus outbreak in China is one such good example. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The question of how to effectively deal with China while protecting Canada?s national interests is apparently a hard one. While the desire is to maintain neutrality and avoid the difficult binary situation of picking a side, Canada may not eventually have the option or the luxury to do so. Canada and the United States are close allies and we share important common interests, from democratic values to international norms and rules, from national security to bilateral trade and economic prosperity. Recent developments have deepened the disagreements between Canada and China, both on domestic political issues and its foreign policy behaviours. These are basic facts.\xa0\xa0(1200)\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To deal with China effectively at this difficult time requires Canada to develop more leverages and influence vis-?-vis China and open up more space, new space, between the U.S. and China in the era of great power competition. Alliance management should not just be the leader of the alliance managing the partners. In these fluid times, it is also critical for the partners to manage the alliance relationship in order to mitigate or minimize the potential chance of victimization or collateral damage on specific issues.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Canada could develop a more astute and sophisticated understanding of China and calibrate the outcomes of each interaction between China and Canada before they happen, but beyond that, how to shape the policies and behaviours of great powers, as well as to prepare for and manage the consequences of decisions, will be of utmost importance. In addition, there are increasing demands among middle powers in Europe and in Asia to develop co-operation among themselves in order to restrain and balance the hostile behaviours of great powers. This is a potential direction that Canada could consider more as a policy orientation as well.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you again, Chair. I look forward to the discussion', " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Ms. Sun, and thank you for your patience with the sound problems we had briefly.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Now we'll go to the first round of questions or comments for six minutes each.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Albas", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I'd like to thank all of our witnesses for their telepresence here today. I appreciate their expertise. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'll start off with you, Mr. Shambaugh. You mentioned that in the United States there is a bilateral hardening of feelings towards the rise of China. Could you elaborate a little further on some of the outcomes or areas that this is being channelled into?, \n\xa0\nMr. David Shambaugh: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Sure. First of all, this is reflected at both societal and governmental levels. The hardening I was referring to referred to the governmental level, but in fact if you look at public opinion polls and surveys of the American public over the last two to three years, you also see an increased percentage?now up into the mid-60s, I believe?of Americans who see China in a so-called unfavourable light.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The suspicions about China are reflected at both governmental and societal levels, I would say, although when I travel across the United States, I, at least, notice a substantial variation in those levels of suspicion. The further west you go, interestingly, the less suspicious Americans are. Those on the west coast?Washington State, Oregon, California?can't get enough of engagement with China, particularly economic and cultural. I don't want to spend much time on this. If you go into the Rocky Mountains, the central south or the upper Midwest and then certainly into parts of the east, you find varying perceptions of China, but overall now, a majority of about two-thirds of Americans see China unfavourably.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The hardening I was referring to, though, is manifest across a number of policy areas. It started under the Obama administration but has really increased during the Trump administration. Export controls have been substantially ramped up. American companies are now forbidden to sell certain items such as chips and other items that go into various electronics, which you know about very well. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We don't really have that much of a controversy in our country about Huawei, strangely enough. We just ban them. We don't allow them to bid on our networks. That's my understanding. Unlike your country and Europe, which are undergoing a big debate on that, we're not really having a debate about it. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There are new executive branch policies about Chinese investment into critical infrastructure. The review procedures of CFIUS, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, have also been strengthened. There are an increasing number of Chinese cases in front of CFIUS, and increasing FBI surveillance, if that's the right word, or FBI monitoring, of Chinese espionage on American campuses, in American laboratories and throughout the private sector. China is by far, if you read the statements of FBI director Wray, the most egregious infringer of American technology theft.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the defence realm, Bonnie can speak to this more. That's more long-standing and predates the Trump administration. You saw what happened last week. It was referenced in this morning's session about the new caps put on Chinese journalists here in the U.S. for four state agencies. There are others, such as screening of visas, for example, of Chinese scholars coming to the United States. The Trump administration has really ramped these up. I wouldn't necessarily call these ?retaliatory?, but rather sober-minded policies to more carefully monitor the extent of the interactions between Chinese and Americans inside the United States. That's to say nothing about the long-standing concerns about American business, American academia and American government, including public diplomacy", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Sir, I do have limited time, and I do appreciate that. It sounds to me, though, that for the Americans institutionally, whether it's through legal channels or reciprocity-type actions, there seems to be a more bipartisan approach when it comes to these things. I appreciate that. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Sun, in your comments, at least what I took from it, you talked about the need for a country like Canada to not only become more aware of some of the historical and cultural grievances that China views for itself and how it views the world in some of its foreign policy decisions, but that for a small and open trading country like Canada we need to be far more proactive than reactive. Is that right?, \n\xa0\nMs. Yun Sun: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes. Thank you, sir, for your question.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To answer that question, I think that first I will agree with Professor Shambaugh's assessment that China should not be treated as a ?civilization?, as just a cultural concept. It is a real country, with real political thinking in its foreign policy behaviour and with assertive instruments to pursue those foreign policy goals. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think it is highly important for a country such as Canada to develop an accurate and sophisticated understanding of what China is and what China's action plans really indicate. For example, in the case of the Huawei 5G technology, I think the anticipation of the variations in China's policy reactions would be highly necessary in this decision-making", " \n\xa0\nMr. Dan Albas: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Just to sum up, there has been some question about whether or not we should be taking the side of the United States or the side of China. I'm not going to get into that, other than to say that, nine times out of 10, I'm always going to be on the side of a democratic country", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Yip, you have six minutes', ' \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip (Scarborough?Agincourt, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Last December, the U.S. and China reached a phase one trade deal whereby China would have to make significant additional purchases of U.S. goods and services. How will a phase one trade deal between the U.S. and China affect the competitiveness of Canadian firms that export to or operate in China?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That is open to everyone', " \n\xa0\nMs. Bonnie Glaser: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'll start.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 None of us are trade experts. I know that you've already had a witness from Canada West, I think it was, at the end of last month, who talked about some of the implications of what is a managed trade deal. If China has to buy all of its soybeans, or most of them, from the United States, that will have a negative impact on other countries that produce them. Brazil is certainly at the top of that list, but also Canada.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Of course, the targets that were set are really quite high. I think that many people in the United States have been skeptical that China will actually be able to meet those targets. Also, with the COVID-19 epidemic now, it seems even more unlikely that it will reach those targets. It remains to be seen whether China buys a great deal of agricultural products from countries other than the United States as it struggles to meet even the commitments that it has made so far", " \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Do you feel that this trade deal will impact Canada's relations with the U.S.?, \n\xa0\nMr. David Shambaugh: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Not necessarily the phase one trade deal, not in the way that Bonnie just mentioned in the agricultural domain, but I think that some of the successes that came out of phase one with respect to intellectual property rights protection and no forced technology transfer will benefit Canada. That benefits all OECD countries.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There are some positives in the phase one deal of which Canada is a beneficiary, but the real essence of the trade negotiation between the United States and China was not really addressed in the phase one deal. It's all about systemic structural reforms in the Chinese economy. Those were all kicked down the road for a phase two negotiation, which at least here in Washington there's not much expectation for, at least during this administration.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would say that in getting towards phase two, whether in this or the next administration, it has to be pursued multilaterally with Canada, other OECD countries and G7 members together, because we all share the same interest in opening the Chinese economy, a level playing field and getting China to play by international and particularly WTO rules", ' \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0How do you think this would continue with a Democratic president and its impact on Canada?, \n\xa0\nMs. Bonnie Glaser: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If a Democrat were to win in November and the majority of the tariffs that the United States has placed on China remain in place?and I think it is highly likely that they would not be lifted by the end of this year?then it is unlikely that any Democratic president is going to come into office and simply lift those tariffs. There would have to be negotiations. China would have to make concessions in order to get those tariffs lifted.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think an incoming Democrat is likely to continue being tough on trade. They might use some different levers and, hopefully, as David just said, work multilaterally with other like-minded countries, OECD countries, and work perhaps within the World Trade Organization to update that organization and its rules, so that we can use the common efforts of countries to reach shared goals', " \n\xa0\nMr. David Shambaugh: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would just add briefly that beyond the trade realm, if there is a Democratic administration after next January, I don't think there's going to be a great deal of change in the American approach to China. If it's Biden, I submit to you to read his article in the current issue of Foreign Affairs and what he has to say about China there, which is at variance with his previous positions, to be sure. Nonetheless, he uses pretty tough language in that article about his views. Bernie Sanders is still a work in progress on many things, including China, so I'm not sure. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There has been a sea change, and what I want you north of the border to know is that there has been a fundamental sea change in American thinking about China, and it's bipartisan across the aisle and across the United States. You're not going to see a lot of change if the Democrats gain the White House next year. In fact, you can see?, \n\xa0\nMs. Jean Yip: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 This is a question for Ms. Sun.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Norway and China had a period during which it took six years for relations to be normalized. Do you believe it will be the same for Canada? What can we do to alleviate the current strain in relations? I think you talked about leverages for Canada", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could you give us an answer in about 25 seconds, please?, \n\xa0\nMs. Yun Sun: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It was the long winter of diplomatic freeze between Beijing and Oslo for about nine years following the Liu Xiaobo case. Eventually the Chinese were able to move on from that case, not only because China needed the Nordic countries' help in terms of their Arctic policy and other matters in the international arena, but also because there was this sense that after nine years the issue of Liu Xiaobo was no longer as pressing for the Chinese government. Canada could wait for this issue to go away", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Bergeron, you have six minutes', " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you Mr.\xa0Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'd like to thank our witnesses for their most enlightening contributions to our work.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I understand from the various testimonies we've heard so far that Canada must seek to work multilaterally to try to find solutions, since individual states, in isolation, are generally not able to stand up to Chinese pressure. We must therefore work multilaterally so that there is a sufficiently strong or important counterpart to eventually make the Chinese government move.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I also understand that China is seeking to challenge the alliance system inherited from World War\xa0II. At the same time, we can see that the current administration in Washington has a variable-geometry attitude toward its allies, whether they are NATO allies or G7 allies.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm addressing our three witnesses. First, is China taking advantage of Washington's variable-geometry attitude toward its allies?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Furthermore, is it seeking to use divisions among the allies to score points with each of them? , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To which witness are you directing your question?, \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's addressed to all of the witnesses", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Who would like to answer?, \n\xa0\nMr. David Shambaugh: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would say the answer is, absolutely. This is not new. China has never accepted these alliances. It may have been quieter about its opposition, particularly after 1998-99, when it got push-back from the United States about its criticism, but it has always opposed these alliances. It's constantly sought to probe them, undermine them and split American allies off from the United States, and even from one another. There is nothing new, I would say, in that regard. What is new is the current American administration, which has also called into question NATO, at least, and has not worked nearly as effectively as it could have to bolster the alliances in East Asia and other parts of the world", " \n\xa0\nMs. Bonnie Glaser: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I would just add that the Chinese, I think, are ambivalent about the Trump administration. They don't like its approach, of course, to imposing tariffs on China, but they see the Trump administration policy towards allies and towards multilateral organizations as the gift that keeps on giving. The U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate change agreement, its not going forward with the trans-Pacific partnership, its undermining of the World Trade Organization, and a host of other examples have allowed Xi Jinping to present China as the champion of globalization and of liberalization of trade, and also to persuade countries that China, as opposed to the United States, is the rule-abiding member of the international system. This has been an unfortunate set of advantages that China is taking as a result of the Trump administration's policies. , \n\xa0\nMs. Yun Sun: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The strategy of the Trump administration in the western Pacific region has led to obvious patching-up behaviours by both Japan and South Korea when it comes to their relationship with China. In South Asia, we're seeing India demonstrating similar patterns of behaviours as well. This almost release of the international system or the international space provides China with the alternative model and the alternative paths to claim China's leadership in these spaces", " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Government of Canada was reduced, in the arrest of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, to calling for U.S. intervention. Although there can be no doubt that the U.S. was sympathetic to Canada's situation, and even intervened with the Chinese authorities?something they did not particularly appreciate?it must be recognized that in the last agreement between the United States and China, the United States and China essentially sought to preserve their interests and not those of the western world?let us call it that for the sake of argument.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Is this in addition to the difficulties we are currently experiencing with the multilateral intervention you are suggesting, particularly through a fund to protect companies doing business with China, for example?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 You have about 30 seconds, I'm afraid", " \n\xa0\nMs. Bonnie Glaser: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The suggestion put forward was mine. I think that when countries have been subject to Chinese coercion, nobody has been there to help them. Even with South Korea, a close U.S. ally, when China stopped buying so many of the goods of the Lotte company and put a lot of political pressure on South Korea, the United States did not stand up and help. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0So I think this is an opportunity for like-minded countries to build a fund that, even if it were never used, would signal to Beijing that countries that are targeted by this kind of economic coercion from China are willing to work together. They're willing to stand up to China, and Beijing fears?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm afraid I have to interrupt. I'm sorry.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Bergeron, your time is up.[English]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. McPherson, please go ahead for six minutes", " \n\xa0\nMs. Heather McPherson (Edmonton Strathcona, NDP): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Chair. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'd like to thank the people who have come and who are sharing their expertise with us.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Bonnie, I will give you a bit of an opportunity to finish some of those thoughts if you'd like. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We talk about China using its economic leverage and we talk about China detaining citizens of other countries, including Canada, of course. I hear what you're saying when you speak about China respecting strength, but knowing where Canada sits and knowing that we have limited strength and knowing that our opportunities to work multilaterally have some limitations of course, globally, can you talk a little bit more?and maybe, Bonnie, you could finish off what you were saying earlier?about those things that you think would work? The idea of a tougher approach is what I think I'm hearing, and there's this idea that China does respect strength. What are the risks of that?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could you also talk about where you've seen successes for other countries, particularly countries other than the U.S", " countries that are not superpowers but middle powers like Canada?, \n\xa0\nMs. Bonnie Glaser: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's a very important question.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To quickly finish my thought, Beijing fears the formation of an anti-China coalition of other countries working together to push back against China. I really do feel that this is an area that should be exploited.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'll cite the example of one country that I think has done particularly well, and that is Japan. Japan has basically been in the doghouse since 2012, when the government purchased some of the disputed Senkaku islands from some private Japanese citizens. The Chinese started introducing law enforcement ships in the territorial waters around these disputed islands. There were other pressures put on Japan, but the Chinese goal was to get the government in Tokyo, led by Prime Minister Abe, to acknowledge that a territorial dispute exists, because Japan has long said there is no dispute. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Fast-forward to today, and here we are eight years later. Yes, it has taken a long time, although the relationship gradually began to improve, and I would say the turn was in December 2014. Xi Jinping was supposed to go for a summit next month, which has been postponed only because of the COVID-19 virus, but these relations have improved, and Prime Minister Abe has not made core concessions on this territorial issue that China really cares about.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Does Japan have leverage? Certainly. Japan probably has more investment in China and more trade with China than Canada has, but ultimately I think Beijing saw that this prolonged downturn in relations did not serve its interests, and it looked for common ground with Japan and Prime Minister Abe", ' \n\xa0\nMr. David Shambaugh: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could I add to that?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather McPherson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yes', " \n\xa0\nMr. David Shambaugh: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I very much believe in solidarity amongst like-minded democracies when approaching China in all issue areas. It's absolutely crucial to work together, side by side and not in parallel. I was very interested to read the annexes that Global Affairs Canada provided, in response to previous testimony, in which they claimed they had over a thousand communications with foreign governments in trying to get public support for the two Michaels case. They got 14 countries to speak out. Then there is an interesting list of how they spoke out. Most of those were via tweets. If you're not on Twitter, you don't see them anyway. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This is really lamentable, I think, if not shameful, frankly. It all shows China's real economic power and leverage over other countries. Second, it shows the fear of departing from the engagement paradigm that we have all pursued with China over the last four decades. Whether it's the two Michaels or a number of other issues that are of common concern to OECD countries...and I would again go beyond; this is not just the west we're talking about. Many countries in the global south have difficulties through China's mercantilist trading practices. On a number of security issues in other areas we need to really stand together. Maybe we need an international China summit or something. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 China, however, wants to keep these issues behind closed doors. I notice that many of the diplomats who testified here previously said that they were working very hard behind closed doors to press the case of the two Michaels and other issues. Well, that's exactly where China wants to keep it?behind closed doors. Personally, I think going public about China's egregious behaviour on a wide range of issues, whether it be Tibet, the Uighurs, the two Michaels, Liu Xiaobo or you name it.... China just hates being internationally called out publicly and shamed. You have to keep this issue?, \n\xa0\nMs. Heather McPherson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I have very little time left, so could you talk a little bit about the fact that when we actually bring this out in front, in public, the possibility of retaliation is so much greater? \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You have 10 seconds. Good luck", " \n\xa0\nMr. David Shambaugh: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, absolutely, retaliation is greater. It will happen. We have to enter into it with the expectation that there will be further Chinese retaliation. That's the big choice: Do we go public and confront China on these issues despite the retaliation, or do we not? , \n\xa0\nMs. Heather McPherson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much. Sorry to be so brief", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much, Ms. McPherson.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Now we go to the five-minute round, beginning with Ms. Alleslev', " \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thanks very much to all of you for your thought leadership on one of the most challenging conversations of our time. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Glaser, I know you testified at a committee in the U.S. on the ?made in China 2025? policy. One thing you talked about was the increasing integration of military and civilian commercial economies, essentially. You highlighted that they were doing this with a view toward controlling entire supply chains and obtaining significant market share in targeted industries. I wonder if you could give us a little more information on that, and perhaps advise Canada on what we might be able to do to protect ourselves or to address this increasing challenge. , \n\xa0\nMs. Bonnie Glaser: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The made in China 2025 plan is just one of many industrial policies that Xi Jinping has put forward. I think what surprised many people was that this particular plan was very public and very detailed. It laid out 10 areas of key cutting-edge technologies that China, Xi Jinping says, must be dominant in. We're looking at things like electric cars, for example, semiconductors, and certain areas of transportation. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It remains to be seen, of course, whether China achieves this goal, but if they were to actually achieve a dominant position in most, if not all, of these areas, it really would pose a threat, I think, to many countries that have leadership and of course multinational corporations that have really significant market share. I think the Germans in particular are very worried, as are the Americans. , \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Would you say that that threat was not only an economic one but also a security one?, \n\xa0\nMs. Bonnie Glaser: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Absolutely. Of course it begins with an economic threat, but it is a security threat, and you mentioned the close relationship between the civilian and military sectors in China. This is called civil-military fusion by Xi Jinping. The idea is to make it very easy for innovation in the civilian sector to be shifted over into military spheres and to be applied to military capabilities so that China can gain a rapid advantage over its potential adversaries, the United States being first and foremost", " \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would direct my next question to Ms. Sun, if you wouldn't mind. You made a very important point in your opening remarks, talking about, essentially, the rise of great powers and the shifting economic, political and even military balance in the world as a result. Where does that leave middle powers like Canada, and a number of others? \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You suggest that we need to have increased co-operation of middle powers. Could you give us some ideas on how we might achieve that, particularly in light of the erosion of some of our international institutions that were essentially put in place to have a balance with middle powers. How do we now achieve that co-operation, and what action can Canada take to further that?, \n\xa0\nMs. Yun Sun: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, madam, for your question. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In the era of great power competitions, the erosion of the current international organizations and effective mechanisms is almost inevitable, because you will see both China and the United States reaching out to erode these systems to get their own way. Particularly in the case of China, this is the case. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think, for middle powers like Canada, to keep the plurality of the regions is extremely important. It's not just a mechanism to prevent China from achieving the hegemonic status it desires; it's also to provide regional checks and balances, and the managing mechanism that will bind these great powers with superpower ambition through the norms and rules developed by regional countries.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I agree with you. I think the international systems these days are being eroded, but it doesn't prevent the emergence of other regional forums, regional organizations or regional mechanisms?minilaterals, if you like, or trilaterals?among like-minded countries and countries with similar power status, to develop their common position", ' \n\xa0\nMs. Leona Alleslev: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Ms. Alleslev.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Zann, you have five minutes', " \n\xa0\nMs. Lenore Zann (Cumberland?Colchester, Lib.): \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My question is for Ms. Sun. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Hello. I hope you're doing well today.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We've just celebrated International Women's Day, so my thoughts are turned to the issue of women's rights. On the eve of International Women's Day in 2015, Chinese authorities jailed five feminist activists for planning to hand out stickers on subways and buses against sexual harassment. News of the arrest of the ?feminist five?, as they became known, spread swiftly, sparking global protests and diplomatic outrage. Luckily, the government released the women after 37 days.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Then, on International Women's Day two years ago, Weibo and WeChat both banned the most influential feminist social media account, called Feminist Voices, because it ?posted sensitive and illegal information?. Thousands of students signed #MeToo petitions demanding action against sexual harassment, but many of these petitions were deleted by censors soon after being posted on social media.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The shrinking public space for discussing women's rights in China is very concerning for me. I find it particularly ironic given the importance of gender equality during the communist revolution in the early Mao era, following the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, since the early communists enshrined the equality of women and men in the constitution of the People's Republic, and the government introduced ambitious initiatives to put women to work in building the new communist nation by the 1970s. They in fact boasted that the biggest female workforce in the entire world was in China.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Could you please give us an update on women's rights in China and what Canada and other countries can do to support the feminist movement in China?, \n\xa0\nMs. Yun Sun: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, madam, for your question.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To begin with, there is a cultural element to it because in China, if you look at the top leadership on the Politburo standing committee, there is no female leader at that level. That is just a fact. The Chinese political scientists have attributed this to the Chinese traditional culture, which has been dominated by males. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In terms of looking at women's rights in China, I would say that under Xi Jinping, the political tightening of spaces in almost all areas?not only women but also ethnic minorities, religious groups and democratic political dissidents in China?is intensifying. Women are just one of those areas. If this violation of human rights in China is systematic and widespread, I think the solutions that we need to look at should not focus only on women. , \n\xa0\nMs. Lenore Zann: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I also wanted to ask you about China's role in the developing world and its approach to conflict mediation in that context. In an article that you published in 2019, you said this:\n\n\n\n When viewing the domestic conflicts of a sovereign nation, China sees development and stability as two mutually reinforcing concepts. Instead of focusing on the fair and just distribution of political and economic rights, China prioritises making the economic pie larger so that everyone gets a bigger share.\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What is China's general approach to conflict and governance issues in the developing world? How does that approach compare to the role played by the U.S. and its allies such as Canada and the United Nations?, \n\xa0\nMs. Yun Sun: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0From the Chinese perspective, when they look at conflict mediation, they pretty much follow the Chinese experience. In China, they believe they have achieved a mutually complementary relationship between economic development and political stability. This has happened under the conditions of a strong authoritarian government ruling the whole country.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 When China tries to mediate conflicts in foreign countries, the first condition has always been that China's national interests must be involved. In countries where China does not really have an interest, you rarely see China playing an active role in terms of conflict mediation. In these countries, China tries to preach this Chinese model of stabilization through economic development. This is the case we have seen in Myanmar; this is the case we are seeing in Afghanistan, and this is something that China has been preaching to the North Korean government for a very long time.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What is the difference between the Chinese approach and the western countries' approach? Well, the western approach focuses more on the origin of the conflict. There needs to be a democratic system to ensure and protect rights, to ensure that minorities are protected. The Chinese approach in this sense is much less substantive, because the Chinese prioritize ceasefires rather than a political solution. We see China try to mediate for ceasefires in conflict situations, but they rarely offer the substantive and intellectual framework to lead to an eventual and sustainable peace", ' \n\xa0\nMs. Lenore Zann: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Ms. Zann.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Genuis, you have five minutes', " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you to the witnesses. This has been a really rich discussion over both the last two panels.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to make two comments and then ask a couple of questions that will be directed to Mr. Shambaugh.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First of all, those watching will know that the original agenda for this committee included former Ambassador McCallum, and I want to say from my perspective that it is very important that we do hear from him at some point. I think his perspective will be absolutely vital.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Second, I wanted to respond to a comment I didn't have a chance to respond to earlier. Mr. Fragiskatos was kind of implying that there was a parallel between return of fugitives as a one-off and the negotiation of an extradition treaty. I think it's important that we very much distinguish between those two things. An extradition treaty would go much further than has been contemplated before, and it would give the right of Canadian nationals, for example, to be extradited to China, with all of the concerns that raises. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Having just put those comments on the record?, \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Point of order, Mr. Chair", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mr. Fragiskatos', " \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As we've heard at this committee, the Canadian government has no interest in proceeding with an extradition?, \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's not a point of order. You're better than that. That's?, \n\xa0\nMr. Peter Fragiskatos: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Just to clarify for the record?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Order, order. Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Genuis", " \n\xa0\nMr. Garnett Genuis: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 That is a shameful abuse of procedure, and you know it. I didn't interrupt you when you were directly responding to my comments, so we expect better from you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to ask Mr. Shambaugh two questions. First of all, we have the buzzword ?engagement?, which has been around this committee a lot. You talked about the trap of the so-called engagement paradigm. It's interesting, because all of us would agree that there needs to be engagement with this topic, in terms of having those dialogues and opportunities for conversation. At the same time, we should reject the idea that engagement entails thinking that having a good, collegial, friendly relationship is an end in and of itself. Engaging in a way that shows firmness and consistency and seeks to advance our values and interests is the objective.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Can you talk a bit about what may be good engagement and bad engagement, given the importance of just that word?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Regarding the second question, you wrote an essay for The Wall Street Journal in 2015, in which you imagined the unfolding of.... I don't mean ?imagined? in a pejorative way. You said, ?The endgame of Chinese communist rule has now begun.... Its demise is likely to be protracted, messy and violent.? \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm wondering if you still think, five years later, that we're in the endgame of communist rule in China. All of us here, presumably, would like to see freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law spread around the world, spread to China. Do you think political change in China is possible in the near or medium term? What policy approaches can we use here in Canada to promote the development of a free, multi-party democratic society, and in a way that minimizes any kind of conflagration in the process of transition?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You have two minutes left. Take the whole time however you like", " \n\xa0\nMr. David Shambaugh: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Two minutes, or two hours...?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On your first question, about engagement, I'd recommend the committee read, if it hasn't already, Paul Evans's excellent book entitled Engaging China. It is a history of Canadian relations with China since the Trudeau period and throughout this whole engagement paradigm. Second, read Ambassador David Mulroney, whom I hope you will hear from at the committee. His book Middle Power, Middle Kingdom is an excellent study. He also goes through these issues.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Engagement, in my view, is not an end in itself. It is a means to advancing a national and common international interest. I was also interested in this annex that Global Affairs Canada provided to the committee. There's a very nice organization chart of the probably two dozen or more bilateral dialogues that Canada has with China. When I looked at that chart, it made me think, ?Well, they just see engagement as an end in itself.? Simply having those boxes on that chart is what those diplomats in Global Affairs Canada set out to do, and to have the dialogue is sufficient.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would submit that it is not sufficient. You have to achieve things with dialogues. The United States, by the way, had 94, I think. Bonnie has written about this. We had 94 ongoing dialogues with China when the Trump administration took over. They're now down to fewer than 10. The Trump administration has just cancelled a number of them. Are we any worse off for it? I don't think so. It's a terrible waste of money, resources, time, airplane fuel, etc", " unless you're getting real results.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Engagement, if it's institutional engagement, bilaterally, is a means toward an end in whichever issue or area you're talking about. That's just my brief answer to that", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Oliphant, you have five minutes', " \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much to all our witnesses.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to build on what I thought was a really fine question from Ms. Alleslev. It had to do with Canada's approach. I recognize you're not Canadian. I recognize, in the answers you've given, a very American approach to both foreign policy and to China, which will be absolutely respected by Canada, but you are in a very different power position in the world than Canada. You have economic tools. You have not, as a country, actually engaged multilaterally with China, as you are suggesting is appropriate. You have actually acted as a country unilaterally, many times without looking at the impact on Canada and your allies.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You are suggesting it is very important to act multilaterally, yet the United States is not acting multilaterally. What is it you are really suggesting? I recognize you're coming at it as an American. I hear American language. I hear American politics. I hear American diplomacy, but do you have something to suggest, from that experience, for a small country that necessarily counts on its allies? \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would have all three of you answer, if you would like", " \n\xa0\nMs. Bonnie Glaser: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thank you for the question. I think it's an important one.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm certainly an American, but I'm an expert on China. I examine how countries around the world deal with China and what has worked and what has not. There are many middle powers and others that have been the target of economic pressure from China and have tried different approaches.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I already talked about Japan, so I will take this opportunity to cite Australia, which of course recognized that there was significant political interference in its society, its politics, and decided to pass new laws and prioritize this issue. The lesson from Australia I think is on setting priorities. There have been examples where, frankly, the United States has reached out to Australia and encouraged it to make other things a priority, to add, for example, freedom of navigation in the South China Sea to its list of priorities. The Australians have looked at all the challenges they face with China and said, look, we're going to pick the two or three that are really vital to Australian interests; with regard to the others, we care about the others, but we're not going to try to beat China over the head on everything. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think China has respected that approach", " \n\xa0\nMr. David Shambaugh: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0On the question of multilateralism, I agree with you, sir. The United States has frequently acted unilaterally. Particularly under this administration, it is lamentable, to put it mildly, and it's ineffective.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0With respect to China, the Trump administration's China policies?I personally agree with most of them?would have all been much more effective if they had been coordinated in tandem with other OECD members, including Canada. Going forward, that is absolutely imperative: solidarity, multilateralism, united front approaches to China. Otherwise, they do yi yi zh yi, divide and rule the ?foreign barbarians?, as they call us.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Do you want me to go back to the previous question that I didn't have a chance to answer?, \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Go on, for sure", " \n\xa0\nMr. David Shambaugh: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's linked to Yun Sun's opening statement about China's identity being rooted in the 19th century sort of victim narrative because of its encounter with the west and Japan. I would add that China's identity is also profoundly rooted in the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Communist Party, and the other communist party states in eastern Europe and Mongolia. That lives with the Chinese Communist Party and their leadership on a daily basis. They write about it. They speak about it. They are seized with it.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 So it's not just?, \n\xa0\nMr. Robert Oliphant: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That's helpful. Thanks.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I want to go to Ms. Sun quickly. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Do you have any comment?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You have 30 seconds", " \n\xa0\nMs. Yun Sun: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0First of all, I think Canada needs to develop leverage and influence vis-?-vis China unilaterally, without the collaboration with the United States.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Second, China has an ultimate respect for power. When you look at how India reacted to China in the Doklam standoff, and in South Korea Geun-hye's decision to deploy THAAD, in the end, China paid respect to it. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Certainly, if you look at Europe and how some NATO countries have kept the U.S. at arm's length in order to maintain their policy flexibility, I think there are a lot of lessons to be learned", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you', ' \n\xa0\nMs. Yun Sun: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Last but not least, I think Australia offers a case where allies can be actively shaping U.S. priority and U.S. policy', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.[Translation]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr.\xa0Bergeron, you have two and a half minutes', " \n\xa0\nMr. St?phane Bergeron: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr.\xa0Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0These discussions are simply fascinating.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We finally realize that Canada, like most countries in the world, must try to find its place in this struggle between two superpowers, the United States and China, one being our ally, the other being a power with which we have always had excellent relations in the past.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 What is Russia's place in this new international system that seems to be taking shape, according to what you say?, \n\xa0\nMs. Bonnie Glaser: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Again, none of us are Russia experts, but I can certainly highlight the fact that Russia and China are increasingly working together in the international system. They are working in the UN to develop their own methods of cyber-governance that prioritize sovereignty and oppose individual freedom. They are working together militarily. They are developing, now, early warning systems together. They have worked together on missile defence. We saw, only a few months ago, the first-ever joint patrol between Russian and Chinese air forces fly over territory disputed between South Korea and Japan, aimed at dividing the United States' two allies in Northeast Asia: Japan and South Korea.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think this is because those two countries share an interest in opposing what they see as American hegemony. They want to change the rules, the norms, in the international system. I think the more the United States highlights that both of these countries are revisionist powers, the more this has given them an even greater incentive to work together. , \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 You have 20 seconds", " \n\xa0\nMs. Yun Sun: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Russia is China's strategic partner, and the coordination of their national security and foreign policy strategies has enhanced and intensified in the past several years. They provide neutral support on issues of importance for them, such as China on Syria and Russia on the South China Sea. Russia has been an anchor for China to launch its campaign into the Arctic through the Yamal project and development of the northern sea route", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I appreciate the very short comments. I'm sorry for the very short time we have for all of the questions.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. McPherson, you have two and a half minutes", " \n\xa0\nMs. Heather McPherson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We just talked about Russia. We've certainly spoken quite a lot about the United States today. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Shambaugh, you spoke about the global south, and I know, Ms. Sun, that you spoke a little bit about the increased connection between China and Africa. Is there a potential for us to be building coalitions with countries in sub-Saharan Africa, or has the role China has played in sub-Saharan Africa made that an impossible thing going forward?, \n\xa0\nMr. David Shambaugh: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'll defer to Ms. Sun. I think she knows more about it than I do, but I would just observe that the potential for partnerships between OECD countries and the global south vis-?-vis China and other global issues is substantial. We should think not just about working with like-minded democracies north of the equator; there are numerous democracies south of the equator that are also natural partners for us", ' \n\xa0\nMs. Heather McPherson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Ms. Sun', " \n\xa0\nMs. Yun Sun: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think the theme here is to offer an alternative to what China is offering to Africa. Japan is playing an increasingly big role in this arena, in things other than the Chinese business contracts and Chinese infrastructure projects. I think countries like Canada could provide a very healthy and much more sustainable development path to the countries in Africa, and this also involves significant capacity building that I do believe Canada's foreign aid program is involved in.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0All of these are laying the foundation for a more democratic system and more sustainable development in the African continent", ' \n\xa0\nMs. Heather McPherson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Just to follow up on that, at the moment our development dollars that are going to sub-Saharan Africa are quite low?historically low. Would you see investing in infrastructure in countries in sub-Saharan Africa and increasing the amount of official development assistance that we are allocating to those regions being things in which we could increase capacity?, \n\xa0\nMs. Yun Sun: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think there is an absolute need on the ground, and there is also an absolute sense of urgency', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0There are 15 seconds left if you want to add a comment', " \n\xa0\nMs. Heather McPherson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'm good. Thank you so much", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We still have five minutes.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr. Williamson, you get them', ' \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0All of them', ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Use them wisely', " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chair.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'd like to give our guests the floor and to follow up on what my colleague asked about, the resilience and the strength of the Chinese Communist Party and whether it is a system that is as strong as it appears to be, or if, in fact, there are weaknesses that perhaps we don't see.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I'll turn it over to the three of you. You can police yourselves to have about 90 seconds each. Why don't we start with Ms. Sun, please?, \n\xa0\nMs. Yun Sun: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We get these questions a lot. Is there going to be a military coup in China? Is Xi Jinping going to be overthrown if his policy has been so unpopular in and outside of China?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My answer is no. I think the resilience and the ability of China to adapt and of the Chinese government to adapt to different emerging challenges is quite significant. Professor Shambaugh wrote a book about this?the ability of the Chinese Communist Party to adapt. I think the Chinese Communist Party has not exhausted what the Chinese society can offer them in terms of the adaptation and evolution of the party's struggle to build and strengthen its legitimacy.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This is an evolution of the Communist Party strategy. We're not seeing the end of it yet", " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Chair, what is the time?, \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It's 1:43, so you have three minutes and 15 seconds", " \n\xa0\nMr. John Williamson: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0All right. If you would like to split the time, please go ahead. If you finish up, I'll come up with another question", " \n\xa0\nMs. Bonnie Glaser: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I'll be brief.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I would say that the Chinese Communist Party shows signs of both fragility and resilience. It is very difficult to predict going forward whether it will continue to strengthen itself. I think Xi Jinping has put so many resources and so much energy into strengthening the rule of the party and the role of the party in China that I don't think we are going to see it collapse any time soon.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0But it is noteworthy that, if you take the case of COVID-19 and the reaction of the people, there's a lot of concern and opposition and a sense of frustration in China about the party's inability to deliver good governance. When Dr. Li Wenliang died early on.... Basically, he had been muzzled when he tried to make public the nature of the threat. That's just one example of where people are very frustrated. Could this boil over in ways we don't predict? That's possible, but I don't see collapse of the party any time soon", ' \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You have two minutes, sir', " \n\xa0\nMr. David Shambaugh: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Neither do I, despite the unfortunate headline that The Wall Street Journal chose for my article back in 2015.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Chinese have many phrases that capture complex situations. They have one, ?waiying, neiruan? or ?hard on the outside, soft on the inside?, and that is a good metaphor, I think, for the Chinese Communist Party today. They are definitely hard on the outside. Since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, he has definitely strengthened the party. I would even date the hardening to 2009, which predates his arrival at the top. There's no doubt about it. Why? As I started to say earlier, he's absolutely possessed by the Soviet collapse, and he saw that on China's horizon.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My article was about the same thing. He and I probably didn't disagree about the state of the party in 2010, 2011 or 2012. He has taken certain steps in the last seven years to strengthen the party. It is definitely stronger today organizationally as a Leninist instrument than it was seven years ago, but I would argue that as a normative instrument and in terms of legitimacy it is weaker. The COVID-19 issue shows part of that weakness in terms of monopoly of media.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This is not a party that's about to collapse. I never thought it was. The best word for it is ?atrophy?. All Leninist parties and, I would submit, authoritarian parties atrophy over time. They age like people do and eventually die, unless they're constantly reinventing themselves. There are different ways to reinvent themselves. Xi Jinping has chosen a certain number of lessons from the Soviet collapse, what we would call hardline lessons. There are other, softer lessons that could have been chosen and that his predecessors did. Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao practised what I call ?soft Leninism?. Xi Jinping is hard Leninism, and I think he's actually making the system more brittle and more fragile as a result", " \n\xa0\nThe Chair: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We've had two excellent panels today. I want to thank the three witnesses who are before us at the moment for their testimony.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We are very grateful to you for taking the time to be with us.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Colleagues, this meeting is adjourned.]"]
